    <h2>
      CHAPTER I.&mdash;FIRST GLIMPSE OF THE CARAVAN.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>he afternoon was
      still very warm, but a grey mist, drifting from the Irish Channel and
      sailing eastward over the low-lying Island of Anglesea, was beginning to
      scatter a thin penetrating drizzle on the driver of the caravan.
    </p>
    <p>
      To right and left of the highway stretched a bleak and bare prospect of
      marshland and moorland, closed to the west by a sky of ever-deepening
      redness, and relieved here and there by black clumps of stunted woodland.
      Here and there peeped a solitary farmhouse, with outlying fields of swampy
      greenness, where lean and spectral cattle were lugubriously grazing; and
      ever and anon came a glimpse of some lonely lake or tarn, fringed all
      round with thick sedges, and dotted with water-lilies. The road was as
      desolate as the prospect, with not a living soul upon it, far as the eye
      could see. To all this, however, the driver of the caravan paid little
      attention, owing to the simple fact that he was fast asleep.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was roused by a sudden jolting and swaying of the clumsy vehicle,
      combined with a sound of splashing water, and opening his eyes sleepily,
      he perceived that the grey mare had turned aside from the centre of the
      road, and, having entered a stagnant pond on the roadside, was floundering
      and struggling in the mud thereof, with the caravan rocking behind her. At
      the same moment, a head was thrust round the back part of the vehicle, and
      an angry voice exclaimed&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tim, you scoundrel, where the devil are you driving to? Wake up, or I&rsquo;ll
      break every bone in your skin.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Thus addressed, Tim woke himself with an effort, and looking round with an
      insinuating smile, replied&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Begorra, Master Charles, I thought it was an earthquake entirely&mdash;&mdash;Come
      out of that, now! Is it wanting to drownd yourself you are?&mdash;G-r-r-r!
      Sh! Aisy now, aisy!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The latter portion of the above sentence was addressed to the mare, which
      was at last persuaded to wade out of the cool mud, and return to the dusty
      track, where she stood quivering and panting. No sooner was the return to
      <i>terra firma</i> accomplished than a light agile figure descended the
      steps at the back of the caravan, and ran round to the front. An excited
      colloquy, angry on the one side, and apologetic on the other, ensued, and
      did not cease, even when the driver, with a flick of his whip, put the
      caravan again in motion, while the other strode alongside on foot.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was just such a caravan as may be seen any summer day forming part of
      the camp on an English common, with the swart face of a gipsy woman
      looking out at the door, and half a dozen ragged imps and elves rolling on
      the grass beneath; as may be observed, smothered in wickerwork of all
      descriptions, or glittering pots and pans, moving from door to door in
      some sleepy country town, guided by a gloomy gentleman in a velveteen coat
      and a hareskin cap, and attended by a brawny hussy, also smothered in
      wickerwork or pots and pans; as, furthermore, may be descried forming part
      of the procession of a travelling circus, and drawn by a piebald horse
      which, whenever a good &ldquo;pitch&rdquo; is found, will complete its day&rsquo;s labour by
      performances in the ring. A caravan of the good old English kind, with
      small windows ornamented by white muslin curtains, with a chimney atop for
      the smoke to come through from the fire inside, with a door behind
      ornamented with a knocker, and only lacking a doorplate to make it quite
      complete; in short, a house on wheels.
    </p>
    <p>
      The driver, though rough enough, and red with sun and wind, had nothing in
      common with the ordinary drivers of such vehicles, and, in point of fact,
      he was neither a gipsy, nor a travelling tinker, nor a circus performer.
      Though it was summer-time, he wore a large frieze coat, descending almost
      to his heels, and on his head a wideawake hat, underneath which his lazy,
      beardless, and somewhat sheepish face shone with indolent good humour. His
      companion, Master Charles, as he was called, bore still less resemblance
      to the Bohemians of English lanes and woodlands. He was a slight,
      handsome, fair-haired young fellow of two or three and twenty, in the
      tweed attire of an ordinary summer tourist; and every movement he made,
      every word he spoke, implied the &ldquo;gentleman born.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Presently, at a signal from his master (such he was), Tim drew rein again.
      By this time the sun was setting fiery red, far away to the west, and the
      thin drizzle was becoming more persistent.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How far did they say it was to Pencroes?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ten miles, sor.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The mare is tired out, I think. We shall have to camp by the roadside.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right, Master Charles. There&rsquo;s a handy shelter beyant there where you
      see the trees,&rdquo; Tim added, pointing up the road with his whip. The young
      man looked in that direction, and saw, about a quarter of a mile away,
      that the highway entered a dark clump of woodland. He nodded assent, and
      walked rapidly forward, while the caravan followed slowly in his rear.
    </p>
    <p>
      Reaching the spot where the wood began, and entering the shadow of the
      trees, he soon found a spot well fitted for his purpose. To the left, the
      road widened out into a grassy patch of common, adorned with, one or two
      bushes of stunted brown, and stretched out a dusty arm to touch a large
      white gate, which opened on a gloomy grass-grown avenue winding right
      through the heart of the wood. The caravan, coming slowly up, was soon
      placed in a snug position not far from the gate; the horse was taken out
      and suffered to graze; while Tim, searching about, soon found some dry
      sticks, and began to light a fire. Diving into the caravan, the young man
      re-emerged with a camp-stool, on which he sat down, lighted a meerschaum
      pipe, and began to smoke. They could hear the rain faintly pattering in
      the boughs above them, but the spot they had chosen was quite sheltered
      and dry.
    </p>
    <p>
      The fire soon blazed up. Entering the caravan in his turn, Tim brought out
      a tin kettle full of water, and placed it on the fire, preparatory to
      making tea. He was thus engaged when the sound of horse&rsquo;s hoofs was heard
      along the highway, and presently the figure of a horseman appeared,
      approaching at a rapid trot. As it came near to the group in the wayside,
      the horse shied violently, springing from one side of the road to the
      other, so that its rider, a dark, middle-aged man in an old-fashioned
      cloak, was almost thrown from the saddle. Uttering a fierce oath, he
      recovered himself, and, reining in the frightened animal, looked angrily
      round; then, seeing the cause of the mischance, he forced his horse with
      no small difficulty to approach the figures by the fire.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who are you?&rdquo; he demanded, in harsh, peremptory tones. &ldquo;What are you
      doing here?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The young man, pipe in mouth, looked up at him with a smile, but made no
      reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What are you? Vagrants? Do you know this place is private?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And he pointed with his riding-whip to a printed &ldquo;Notice!&rdquo; fixed close to
      the gate upon the stem of a large fir tree.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I beg your pardon,&rdquo; said the young man, with the utmost <i>sang froid</i>;
      &ldquo;we are, I imagine, on the Queen&rsquo;s highway, and there, with your
      permission, we purpose to remain for the night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Struck by the superior manner of the speaker, the new-comer looked at him
      in some surprise, but with no abatement of his haughty manner. He then
      glanced at Tim, who was busy with the kettle, from Tim to the grey mare,
      and from the grey mare to the house on wheels. The scowl on his dark face
      deepened, and he turned his fierce eyes again on the young man.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let me warn you that these grounds are private. I suffer no wandering
      vagabonds to pass that gate.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;May I ask your name?&rdquo; said the young man in the same cool tones, and with
      the same quiet smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is my name to you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, not much, only I should like to know the title of so very amiable a
      person.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The other condescended to no reply, but walked his horse towards the gate.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here, fellow!&rdquo; he cried, addressing Tim. &ldquo;Open this gate for me!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t stir!&rdquo; said his master. &ldquo;Let our amiable friend open the gate for
      himself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With an angry exclamation, the rider leapt from his saddle, and still
      holding the horse&rsquo;s reins, threw the gate wide open. Then, still leading
      his horse, he strode over towards the young man, who, looking up, saw that
      he was nearly six feet high, and very powerfully built, &ldquo;My name is Monk,
      of Monkshurst,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve a good mind to teach you to remember it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be afraid,&rdquo; was the reply. &ldquo;Monk, of Monkshurst? I shall be certain
      not to forget it, Mr. Monk, of Monkshurst!&mdash;Tim, is the water
      boiling?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      For a moment Mr. Monk, as he called himself, seemed, ready to draw his
      ridingwhip across the young man&rsquo;s face; but, conquering himself, he
      surveyed him from head to foot with savage anger. Nothing daunted, the
      young man returned his stare with something very like supreme contempt. At
      last, muttering beneath his breath, Mr. Monk turned away, and leading his
      horse into the avenue, closed the gate, and remounted; but even then he
      did not immediately depart, but remained for some minutes, seated in the
      saddle, scowling over at the encampment.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus occupied, his face and figure set in the gloomy framework of the
      trees, he looked even more forbidding than before.&rsquo; His face, though
      naturally handsome, was dark with tempestuous passions, his eyes deep-set
      and fierce, his clean-shaven jaw square and determined. For the rest, his
      black hair, which was thickly mixed with iron-grey, fell almost to his
      shoulders, and his upper lip was covered with an iron-grey moustache.
    </p>
    <p>
      At last, as if satisfied with his scrutiny, Mr. Monk turned his horse
      round with a fierce jerk of the rein, and rode rapidly away in the shadow
      of the wood.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER II.&mdash;LEAVES FROM A YOUNG GENTLEMAN&rsquo;S JOURNAL.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">B</span>efore setting
      forth on this memorable pilgrimage to nowhere, I promised a certain friend
      of mine, in literary Bohemia, to keep notes of my adventures, with a view
      to future publication, illustrated by my own brilliant sketches. I fear
      the promise was a rash one, firstly, because I am constitutionally lazy
      and averse to literary exertion; and secondly, because I have, as yet, met
      with no adventures worth writing about. Not that I have altogether lost my
      first enthusiasm for the idea. There would be novelty in the title, at any
      rate: &lsquo;Cruises in a Caravan, by Charles Brinkley, with illustrations by
      the author; photographic frontispiece, the caravan, with Tim as large as
      life, smirking self-consciously in delight at having his &lsquo;pictur&rsquo; taken.
      My friend B&mdash;&mdash;&mdash; has promised to find me a publisher, if I
      will only persevere. Well, we shall see. If the book does not progress, it
      will be entirely my own fault; for I have any amount of time on my hands.
      Paint as hard as I may all day, I have always the long evenings, when I
      must either write, read, or do nothing.
    </p>

      &ldquo;So I am beginning this evening, exactly a fortnight after my first start
      from Chester. I purchased the caravan there from a morose individual with
      one eye, who had had it built with a view to the exhibition of a Wild Man
      of Patagonia, but said Wild Man having taken it into his head to return to
      County Cork, where he was born, and the morose individual having no
      definite idea of a novelty to take his place, the caravan came into the
      market. Having secured this travelling palace, duly furnished with
      window-blinds, a piece of carpet, a chair bedstead, a table, a stove,
      cooking utensils, not to speak of my own artistic paraphernalia, I sent
      over to Mulrany, Co. Mayo, for my old servant, Tim-na-Chaling, or Tim o&rsquo;
      the Ferry&mdash;otherwise Tim Lenney; and with his assistance, when he
      arrived, I purchased a strong mare at Chester Fair. All these
      preliminaries being settled, we started one fine morning soon after
      daybreak, duly bound for explorations along the macadamized highways and
      byways of North Wales.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am pleased to say that Tim, after he had recovered the first shock of
      seeing a peripatetic dwelling-house, took to the idea wonderfully. &lsquo;Sure,
      it&rsquo;s just like the ould cabin at home,&rsquo; he averred, &lsquo;barrin&rsquo; the wheels,
      and the windies, and the chimley, and the baste to pull it along;&rsquo; and I
      think the resemblance would have been complete in his eyes, if there had
      only been two or three pigs to trot merrily behind the back door. As for
      myself, I took to the nomad life as naturally as if I had never in my life
      been in a civilized habitation. To be able to go where one pleased, to
      dawdle as one pleased, to stop and sleep where one pleased, was certainly
      a new sensation. My friends, observing my sluggish ways, had often
      compared me to that interesting creature, the snail; now the resemblance
      was complete, for I was a snail indeed, with my house comfortably fixed
      upon my shoulders, crawling tranquilly along.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course the caravan has its inconveniences. Inside, to quote the
      elegant simile of our progenitors, there is scarcely room enough to swing
      a cat in; and when my bed is made, and Tim&rsquo;s hammock is swung just inside
      the door, the place forms the tiniest of sleeping-chambers. Then our
      cooking arrangements are primitive, and as Tim has no idea whatever of the
      culinary art, beyond being able to boil potatoes in their skins, and make
      very doubtful &lsquo;stirabout,&rsquo; there is a certain want of variety in our
      repasts. To break the monotony of this living I endeavour, whenever we
      come to a town with a decent hotel in it, to take a square meal away from
      home.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Besides the inconveniences which I have mentioned, but which were,
      perhaps, hardly worth chronicling, the caravan has social drawbacks, more
      particularly embarrassing to a modest man like myself. It is confusing,
      for example, on entering a town, or good-sized village, to be surrounded
      by the entire juvenile population, who cheer us vociferously, under the
      impression that we constitute a &lsquo;show,&rsquo; and afterwards, on ascertaining
      their mistake, pursue us with opprobious jeers; and it is distressing to
      remark that our mode of life, instead of inviting confidence, causes us to
      be regarded with suspicion by the vicar of the parish and the local
      policemen. We are exposed, moreover, to ebullitions of bucolic humour,
      which have taken the form of horse-play on more than one occasion. Tim has
      had several fights with the Welsh peasantry, and has generally come off
      victorious; though on one occasion he would have been overpowered by
      numbers if I had not gone to his assistance. Generally speaking, nothing
      will remove from the rural population an idea that the caravan forms an
      exhibition of some sort. When I airily alight and stroll through a
      village, sketch-book in hand, I have invariably at my heels a long
      attendant train of all ages, obviously under the impression that I am
      looking for a suitable &lsquo;pitch,&rsquo; and am going to &lsquo;perform.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To avoid these and similar inconveniences we generally halt for the night
      in some secluded spot&mdash;some roadside nook, or outlying common. But
      there is a fatal attraction in the caravan: it seems to draw spectators,
      as it were, out of the very bowels of the earth. No matter how desolate
      the place we have chosen, we have scarcely made ourselves comfortable when
      an audience gathers, and stragglers drop in, amazed and open-mouthed. I
      found it irksome at first to paint in the open air, with a gazing crowd at
      my back making audible comments on my work as it progressed; but I soon
      got used to it, and having discovered certain good &lsquo;subjects&rsquo; here and
      there among my visitors, I take the publicity now as a matter of course.
      Even when busy inside, I am never astonished to see strange noses
      flattened against the windows&mdash;strange faces peeping in at the door.
      The human temperament accustoms itself to anything. When all is said and
      done, it is flattering to be an object of such public interest; and I do
      believe that when I return to civilization, and find no one caring in the
      least what I do, I shall miss the worldly tribute which is now my daily
      due.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I begin this record in the Island of Anglesea, where we have arrived
      after our fortnight&rsquo;s wanderings in the more mountainous districts of the
      mainland. Anglesea, I am informed, is chiefly famous for its pigs and its
      wild ducks. So far as I have yet explored it, I find it flat and desolate
      enough; but I have been educated in Irish landscapes, and don&rsquo;t object to
      flatness when combined with desolation. I like these dreary meadows, these
      black stretches of melancholy moorland, these wild lakes and lagoons.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At the present moment I am encamped in a spot where, in all probability,
      I shall remain for days. I came upon it quite by accident, about midday
      yesterday, when on my way to the market town of Pencroes; or rather, when
      I imagined that I was going thither, while I had in reality, after
      hesitating at three cross roads, taken the road which led in exactly the
      opposite direction. The way was desolate and dreary beyond measure&mdash;stretches
      of morass and moorland on every side, occasionally rising into heathery
      knolls or hillocks, or strewn with huge pieces of stone like the moors in
      Cornwall Presently the open moorland ended, and we entered a region of
      sandy hillocks, sparsely ornamented here and there with long harsh grass.
      If one could imagine the waves of the ocean, at some moment of wild
      agitation, suddenly frozen to stillness, and retaining intact their
      tempestuous forms, it would give some idea of the hillocks I am
      describing. They rose on every side of the road, completely shutting out
      the view, and their pale livid yellowness, scarcely relieved with a
      glimpse of greenness, was wearisome and lonely in the extreme. As we
      advanced among them, the road we were pursuing grew worse and worse, till
      it became so choked and covered with drifted sand as to be hardly
      recognizable, and I need hardly say that it was hard work for one horse to
      pull the caravan along; more than once, indeed, the wheels fairly stuck,
      and Tim and I had to pull with might and main to get them free.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We had proceeded in this manner for some miles, and I was beginning to
      realize the fact that we were out of our reckoning, when, suddenly
      emerging from between two sand-hills, I saw a wide stretch of green meadow
      land, and beyond it a glorified piece of water. The sun was shining
      brightly, the water sparkled like a mirror, calm as glass, and without a
      breath. As we appeared, a large heron rose from the spot in the water-side
      where we had been standing
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      Still as a stone, without a sound
    </p>
    <p class="indent20">
      Above his dim blue shade,
    </p>
    <p>
      <br />
    </p>
    <p>
      and sailed leisurely away. Around the lake, which was about a mile in
      circumference, the road ran winding till it reached the further side,
      where more sand-hills began; but between these sand-hills I caught a
      sparkling glimpse of more water, and (guided to my conclusion by the red
      sail of a fishing-smack just glimmering in the horizon line) I knew that
      further water was&mdash;the sea.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The spot had all the charm of complete desolation, combined with the
      charm which always, to my mind, pertains to lakes and lagoons. Eager as a
      boy or a loosened retriever, I ran across the meadow, and found the grass
      long and green, and sown with innumerable crowsfoot flowers; underneath
      the green was sand again, but here it glimmered like gold-dust. As I
      reached the sedges on the lake-side, a teal rose in full summer plumage,
      wheeled swiftly round the lake, then returning, splashed down boldly, and
      swam within a stone&rsquo;s throw of the shore, when, peering through the
      rushes, I caught a glimpse of his mate, paddling anxiously along with
      eight little fluffs of down behind her. Then, just outside the sedges, I
      saw the golden shield of water broken by the circles of rising trout. It
      was too much. I hastened back to the caravan, and informed Tim that I had
      no intention of going any further&mdash;that day at least.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So here we have been since yesterday, and, up to this, have not set eyes
      upon a single soul. Such peace and quietness is a foretaste of Paradise.
      As this is the most satisfactory day I have yet spent in my pilgrimage,
      although it bears, at the same time, a family likeness to the other days
      of the past fortnight, I purpose setting down verbatim, seriatim, and
      chronologically the manner in which I occupied myself from dawn to sunset.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;6 a.m.&mdash;Wake and see that Tim has already disappeared, and folded up
      his hammock. Observe the morning sun looking in with a fresh cheery
      countenance at the window. Turn over again with a yawn, and go to sleep
      for another five minutes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;7.15 a.m.&mdash;Wake again, and discover, by looking at my watch, that
      instead of five minutes I have slept an hour and a quarter. Spring up at
      once, and slip on shirt and trousers; then pass out, barefooted, into the
      open air. No sign of Tim, but a fire is lighted close to the caravan,
      which shadows it from the rays of the morning sun. Stroll down to the
      lake, and, throwing off what garments I wear, prepare for a bath. Cannot
      get out for a swim on account of the reeds. The bath over, return and
      finish my toilet in the caravan.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;8 a.m.&mdash;Tim has reappeared. He has been right down to the sea-shore,
      a walk of about two miles and a half. He informs me, to my disgust, that
      there is some sort of a human settlement there, and a lifeboat station. He
      has brought back in his baglet, as specimens of the local products, a
      dozen new-laid eggs, some milk, and a loaf of bread. The last, I observe,
      is in a fossil state. I asked who sold it him? He answers, William Jones.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;8.30 a.m.&mdash;We breakfast splendidly. Even the fossil loaf yields
      sustenance, after it is cut up and dissolved in hot tea. Between whiles,
      Tim informs me that the settlement down yonder is, in his opinion, a poor
      sort of a place. There are several white-washed cottages, and a large
      roofless house for all the world like a church. Devil the cow or pig did
      he see at all, barrin&rsquo; a few hens. Any boats? I ask. Yes, one with the
      bottom knocked out, belonging to William Jones.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tim has got this name so pat, that my curiosity begins to be aroused.
      &lsquo;Who the deuce <i>is</i> William Jones?&rsquo; &lsquo;Sure, thin,&rsquo; says Tim, &lsquo;he&rsquo;s the
      man that lives down beyant, by the sea.&rsquo; I demand, somewhat irritably, if
      the place contains only one inhabitant. Devil another did Tim see, he
      explains,&mdash;barrin&rsquo; William Jones.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;2.30 a.m. (s.c.)&mdash;Start painting in the open air, under the shade of
      a large white cotton umbrella. Paint on till 1 p.m.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;1 p.m.&mdash;Take a long walk among the sand-hills, avoiding the
      settlement beyond the lake. Don&rsquo;t want to meet any of the aboriginals,
      more particularly William Jones. Walking here is like running up and down
      Atlantic billows, assuming said billows to be solid; now I am lost in the
      trough of the sand, now I re-emerge on the crest of the solid wave.
      Amusing, but fatiguing. I soon lose myself, every hillock being exactly
      like another. Suddenly, a hare starts from under my feet, and goes
      leisurely away. I remember an old amusement of mine in the west of
      Ireland, and I track puss by her footprints&mdash;now clearly and
      beautifully printed in the soft sand of the hollows, now more faintly
      marked on the harder sides of the ridges. The sun blazes down, the
      refraction of the heat from the sand is overpowering, the air is
      quivering, sparkling, and pulsating, as if full of innumerable
      sand-crystals. A horrible croak from overhead startles me, and looking up,
      I see an enormous raven, wheeling along in circles, and searching the
      ground for mice or other prey.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Looking at my watch, I find that I have been toiling in this sandy
      wilderness for quite two hours. Time to get back and dine. Climb the
      nearest hillock, and look round to discover where I am. Can see nothing
      but the sandy billows on every side, and am entirely at a loss which way
      to go. At last, after half an hour&rsquo;s blind wandering, stumble by accident
      on the road by the lakeside, and see the caravan in the distance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;4 p.m.&mdash;Dinner. Boiled potatoes, boiled eggs, fried bacon. Tim&rsquo;s
      cooking is primitive, but I could devour anything&mdash;even William
      Jones&rsquo;s fossil bread. I asked if any human being has visited the camp.
      &lsquo;Sorra one,&rsquo; Tim says, looking rather disappointed. He has got to feel
      himself a public character, and misses the homage of the vulgar.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Paint again till 6 p.m.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A beautiful sunset. The sand-hills grow rosy in the light, the lake
      deepens from crimson to purple, the moon comes out like a silver sickle
      over the sandy sea. A thought seizes me as the shadows increase. Now is
      the time to entice the pink trout from their depths in the lake. I get out
      my fishing-rod and line, and, selecting two or three flies which seem
      suitable, prepare for action. My rod is only a small singlehanded one, and
      it is difficult to cast beyond the sedges, but the fish are rising thickly
      out in the tranquil pools, and, determined not to be beaten, I wade in to
      the knees. Half a dozen small trout, each about the size of a small
      herring, reward my enterprise. When I have captured them, the moon is high
      up above the sand-hills, and it is quite dark.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Such is the chronicle of the past day. By the light of my lamp inside the
      caravan I have written it down. It has been all very tranquil and
      uneventful, but very delightful, and a day to be marked with a white stone
      in one respect&mdash;that from dawn to sunset I have not set eyes on a
      human being, except my servant.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stop, though! I am wrong. Just as I was returning from my piscatorial
      excursion to the lake I saw, passing along the road in the direction of
      the sea, a certain solitary horseman, who accosted me not too civilly on
      the roadside the night before last. He scowled at me in passing, and of
      course recognized me by the aid of the caravan. His name is Monk, of
      Monkshurst, and he seems to be pretty well monarch of all he surveys. I
      have an impression that Mr. Monk, of Monkshurst, and myself are destined
      to be better, or worse, acquainted.&rdquo;

      CHAPTER III.&mdash;MATT MAKES HER FIRST APPEARANCE.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">E</span>ureka! I have had
      an adventure at last; and yet, after all, what am I talking about? It is
      no adventure at all, but only a commonplace incident. This is how it
      happened.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was seated this morning before my easel, out in the open air, painting
      busily, when I thought I heard a movement behind me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should have premised, by the way, that Tim had gone off on another
      excursion into the Jones&rsquo;s territory, on the quest for more eggs and milk.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I glanced over my shoulder, and saw, peering round the corner of my white
      sunshade, a pair of large eager eyes&mdash;fixed, not upon me, but upon
      the canvas I was painting.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not in the least surprised, I thought to myself, &lsquo;At last! The caravan
      has exercised its spell upon the district, and the usual audience is
      beginning to gather.&rsquo; So I went tranquilly on with my work, and paid no
      more attention.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Presently, however, fatigued with my work, I indulged in a great yawn,
      and rose to stretch myself. I then perceived that my audience was more
      select than numerous, consisting of only one individual&mdash;a young
      person in a Welsh chimney-pot hat. Closer observation showed me that said
      hat was set on a head of closely cropped curly black hair, beneath which
      there shone a brown boyish face freckled with sun and wind, a pair of
      bright black eyes, and a laughing mouth with two rows of the whitest of
      teeth. But the face, though boyish, did not belong to a boy. The young
      person was dressed in an old cotton gown, had a coloured woollen shawl or
      scarf thrown oyer the shoulders, and wore thick woollen stockings and
      rough shoes, the latter many sizes too large. The gown was too short for
      the wearer, who had evidently outgrown it; it reached only just below the
      knee, and when the young person moved one caught a glimpse of something
      very much resembling a dilapidated garter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The young person&rsquo;s smile was so bright and good-humoured that I found
      myself answering it with a friendly nod.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;How are you?&rsquo; I said gallantly. &lsquo;I hope you are quite well?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She nodded in reply, and stooping down, plucked a long blade of grass,
      which she placed in her mouth and began to nibble&mdash;bashfully, I
      thought.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;May I ask where you come from?&rsquo; I said. &lsquo;I mean, where do you live?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Without speaking, she stretched out her arm and pointed across the lake
      in the direction of the sea. I could not help noticing then, as an artist,
      that the sleeve of her gown was loose and torn, and that her arm was round
      and well-formed, and her hand, though rough and sun-burned, quite
      genteelly small.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;If it is not inquisitive, may I ask your name?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Matt,&rsquo; was the reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Is that all? What is your other name?&rsquo; &ldquo;&lsquo;I&rsquo;ve got no other name. I&rsquo;m
      Matt, I am.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Indeed. Do your parents live here?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Got no parents,&rsquo; was the reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Your relations, then. You belong to some one, I suppose?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She gave me another nod.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; she answered, nibbling rapidly. &lsquo;I belong to William Jones.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Oh, to <i>him</i>,&rsquo; I said, feeling as familiar with the name as if I
      had known it all my life. &lsquo;But he&rsquo;s not your father?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She shook her head emphatically.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;But of course he&rsquo;s a relation?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Another shake of the head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;But you belong to him?&rsquo; I said, considerably puzzled. &lsquo;Where were you
      born?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;I wasn&rsquo;t born at all,&rsquo; answered Matt. &lsquo;I come ashore.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This was what the immortal Dick. Swiveller would have called a
      &lsquo;staggerer.&rsquo; I looked at the girl again, inspecting her curiously from top
      to toe. Without taking her eyes from mine, she stood on one leg bashfully,
      and fidgeted with the other foot. She was certainly not bad-looking,
      though, evidently a very rough diamond. Even the extraordinary head-gear
      became her well. &ldquo;&lsquo;I know what you are doing there,&rsquo; she cried suddenly,
      pointing to my easel. &lsquo;You, was painting!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      The discovery not being a brilliant one, I took no trouble to confirm it;
      but Matt thereupon walked over to the canvas, and, stooping down, examined
      it with undisguised curiosity. Presently she glanced again at me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;I know what <i>this</i> is,&rsquo; she cried, pointing. &lsquo;It&rsquo;s water. And
      that&rsquo;s the sky. And that&rsquo;s trees. And these here&rsquo;&mdash;for a moment she
      seemed in doubt, but added hastily&mdash;&lsquo;pigs.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, as the subject represented a flock of sheep huddling together close
      to a pond on a rainy common, this suggestion was not over complimentary to
      my artistic skill. I was on the point of correcting my astute critic, when
      she added, after a moment&rsquo;s further inspection&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;No; they&rsquo;re sheep. Look ye now, I know! They&rsquo;re sheep.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Pray, don&rsquo;t touch the paint,&rsquo; I suggested, approaching her in some
      alarm. &lsquo;It is wet, and comes off.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She drew back cautiously; and then, as a preliminary to further
      conversation, sat down on the grass, giving me further occasion to remark
      her length and shapeliness of limb. There was a free-and-easiness, not to
      say boldness, about her manner, tempered though it was with gusts of
      bashfulness, which began to amuse me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Can you paint faces?&rsquo; she asked dubiously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I replied that I could even aspire to that accomplishment, by which I
      understood her to mean portrait painting, if need were. She gave a quiet
      nod of satisfaction.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There was a painter chap came to Aberglyn last summer, and he painted
      William Jones.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Indeed?&rsquo; I said, with an assumption of friendly interest.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Yes; I wanted him to paint <i>me</i>, but he wouldn&rsquo;t. He painted
      William Jones&rsquo;s father though, along o&rsquo; William Jones.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This with an air of unmistakable disgust and recrimination. I looked at
      the girl more observantly. It had never occurred to me till that moment
      that she would make a capital picture,&mdash;just the sort of &lsquo;study&rsquo;
      which would fetch a fair price in the market. I adopted her free and easy
      manner, which was contagious, and sat down on the grass opposite to her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;I tell you what it is, Matt,&rsquo; I said familiarly, &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll paint you, though
      the other painter chap wouldn&rsquo;t.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;You will!&rsquo; she cried, blushing with delight.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Certainly; and a very nice portrait I think you&rsquo;ll make. Be good enough
      to take off your hat that I may have a better look at you.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She obeyed me at once, and threw the clumsy thing down on the grass
      beside her. Then I saw that her head was covered with short black curls,
      clinging round a bold white brow unfreckled by the sun. She glanced at me
      sidelong, laughing and showing her white teeth. Whatever her age was she
      was quite old enough to be a coquette.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Promptly as possible I put the question: &lsquo;You have not told me how old
      you are?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Fifteen,&rsquo; she replied without hesitation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;I should have taken you to be at least a year older.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She shook her head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;It&rsquo;s fifteen year come Whitsuntide,&rsquo; she explained, &lsquo;since I come
      ashore.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Although I was not a little curious to know what this &lsquo;coming ashore&rsquo;
      meant, I felt that all my conversation had been categorical to monotony,
      and I determined, therefore, to reserve further inquiry until another
      occasion. Observing that my new friend was now looking at the caravan with
      considerable interest, I asked her if she knew what it was, and if she had
      ever seen anything like it before. She replied in the negative, though I
      think she had a tolerably good guess as to the caravan&rsquo;s uses. I thought
      this a good opportunity to show my natural politeness. Would she like to
      look at the interior? She said she would, though without exhibiting much
      enthusiasm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thereupon led the way up the steps and into the vehicle. Matt followed;
      but, so soon as she caught a glimpse of the interior, stood timidly on the
      threshold. What is there in the atmosphere of a house, even the rudest,
      which places the visitor at a disadvantage as compared with the owner?
      Even animals feel this, and dogs especially, when visiting strange
      premises, exhibit most abject humility. But I must not generalize. The
      bearings of this remark, to quote my friend Captain Cuttle, lie in the
      application of it. Matt for a moment was awed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Come in, Matt; come in,&rsquo; I said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She came in by slow degrees; and I noticed for the first time&mdash;seeing
      how near her hat was to the roof,&mdash;that she was unusually tall. I
      then did the honours of the place; showed her my sleeping arrangements, my
      culinary implements, everything that I thought would interest her. I
      offered her the armchair, or turned-up bedstead; but she preferred a stool
      which I sometimes used for my feet, and sitting down upon it, looked round
      her with obvious admiration.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Should you like to live in a house like this?&rsquo; I asked encouragingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She shook her head with decision.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Why not?&rsquo; I demanded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She did not exactly know why, or at any rate could not explain. Wishing
      to interest and amuse her, I handed her a portfolio of my sketches,
      chiefly in pencil and pen-and-ink, but a few in water-colours. Her manner
      changed at once, and she turned them over with little cries of delight. It
      was clear that Matt had a taste for the beautiful in Art, but her chief
      attraction was for pictures representing the human face or figure.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Among the sketches she found a crayon drawing of an antique and
      blear-eyed gentleman in a skull cap, copied from some Rembrandtish picture
      I had seen abroad.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;I know who this is!&rsquo; she exclaimed. &lsquo;It&rsquo;s William Jones&rsquo;s father!&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I assured her on my honour that William Jones&rsquo;s father was not personally
      known to me, but she seemed a little incredulous. Presently she rose to
      go.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      "'I can't stop no longer,' she explained; 'I've got to go up to Monkshurst
      for William Jones.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Monkshurst? Is that where the polite Mr. Monk resides?'
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Yes; up in the wood,' she replied, with a grimace expressive of no
      little dislike.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Is Mr. Monk a friend of yours?'
    </p>
    <p>
      "Her answer was a very decided negative. Then, slouching to the door, she
      swung herself down to the ground. I followed, and stood on the threshold,
      looking down at her.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Don't forget that I'm to paint your picture,' I said. 'When will you
      come back?'
    </p>
    <p>
      "'To-morrow, may be.'
    </p>
    <p>
      "'I shall expect you. Good-by!'
    </p>
    <p>
      "'Good-by, master,' she returned, reaching up to shake hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I watched her as she walked away toward the road, and noticed that she
      took bold strides like a boy. On reaching the road, she looked back and
      laughed, then she drew herself together, and began running like a young
      deer, with little or nothing of her former clumsiness, until she
      disappeared among the sand-hills.
    </p>
    <p>
      "Thursday.&mdash;This morning, just after breakfast, when I had entered
      the Caravan to prepare my materials for the day's painting, Tim appeared
      at the door with a horrid grin.
    </p>
    <p>
      "'There's a young lady asking for ye,' he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I had forgotten for the moment my appointment of the day before, and,
      when I leaped from the Caravan, I perceived, standing close by, with her
      back to me, and her face toward the lake, the figure of a young woman. At
      first I failed to identify her, for she wore a black hat and a white
      feather, a cloth jacket, and a dress which almost reached the ground; but
      she turned round as I approached her, and I recognized my new
      acquaintance.
    </p>
    <p>
      "I can not say that she was improved by her change of costume. In the
      first place, it made her look several years older&mdash;in fact, quite
      young-womanly. In the second place, it was tawdry, not to say,
      servant-gally, if I may coin such an adjective. The dress was of thin
      silk, old and frayed, and looking as if it had suffered a good deal from
      exposure to the elements, as was indeed the actual case. The jacket was
      also old, and seemed made of the rough material which is usually cut into
      sailors' pea-jackets; which was the case also. The hat was obviously new,
      but, just as obviously, home-made.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;So you have come,&rsquo; I said, shaking hands. &lsquo;Upon my word, I didn&rsquo;t know
      you.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She laughed delightedly, and glanced down at her attire, which clearly
      afforded her the greatest satisfaction.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;I put on my Sunday clothes,&rsquo; she explained, &ldquo;cause I was going to have
      my likeness took. Don&rsquo;t you tell William Jones.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I promised not to betray her to that insufferable nuisance, and refrained
      from informing her that I thought her ordinary costume far more becoming
      than her seventh-day finery.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;That&rsquo;s a nice dress,&rsquo; I said, hypocritically. &lsquo;Where did you buy it?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;I didn&rsquo;t buy it. It come ashore.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;What! When you &ldquo;come ashore&rdquo; yourself?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;No fear!&rsquo; she answered. &lsquo;Last winter when the big ship went to bits out
      there.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Oh, I see! Then it was a portion of a wreck?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Yes, it come ashore, and, look ye now, this jacket come ashore too. On a
      sailor chap.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;And the sailor chap made you a present of it, I suppose?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;No fear!&rsquo; she repeated, with her sharp shake of the head. &lsquo;How could he
      give it me, when he was drownded and come ashore? William Jones gave it to
      me, and I altered it my own self, look ye now, to make it fit.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She was certainly an extraordinary young person, and wore her mysterious
      finery with a coolness I thought remarkable, it being quite clear, from
      her explanation, that all was fish that came to her net, or, in other
      words, that dead men&rsquo;s clothes were as acceptable to her unprejudiced
      taste as any others. However, the time was hastening on, and I had my
      promise to keep. So I got my crayon materials, and made Matt sit down
      before me on a stool, first insisting, however, that she should divest
      herself of her head-gear, which was an abomination, but which she
      discarded with extreme reluctance. Directly I began, she became rigid, and
      fixed herself, so to speak, as people do when being photographed&mdash;her
      eyes glaring on vacancy, her whole face lost in self-satisfied vacuity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;You needn&rsquo;t keep like that,&rsquo; I cried, &lsquo;I want your face to have some
      expression. Move your head about as much as you like, laugh and talk&mdash;it
      will be all the better.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Last time I was took,&rsquo; she replied, &lsquo;the chap said I mustn&rsquo;t move.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Ah! I suppose he was a travelling photographer.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He had a little black box, like, on legs, and a cloth on top of it, and
      he looked at me through a hole in the middle. Then he cried, &lsquo;Now,&rsquo; and
      held up his hand for me to keep still as a mouse; then he counted fifty&mdash;and
      I was took.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Ah! Indeed! Was it a good likeness?&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Yes, master. But I looked like the black woman who come ashore last
      Easter was a year.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;With conversation like this we beguiled the time, while I proceeded
      rapidly with my drawing. At the end of a couple of hours Matt had become
      so fidgety that I thought it advisable to give her a rest. She sprang up
      and ran over to inspect the picture. The moment her eyes fell upon it, she
      uttered a rapturous cry.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Look ye now, ain&rsquo;t it pretty? Master, am I like <i>that?</i>&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I answered her it was an excellent likeness, and not too flattering. Her
      face fell however a little as she proceeded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Are my cheeks as red as that, master?&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;You are red, Matt,&rsquo; I replied, flippantly; &lsquo;so are the roses.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She looked at me thoughtfully. &lsquo;When it&rsquo;s finished, will you give it to
      me to keep?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Well, we shall see.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;I gave t&rsquo;other chap a shilling for his, frame and all, but I&rsquo;ve got no
      more money,&rsquo; she continued, with an insinuating smile, which, as a man of
      gallantry, I could not resist. So I promised that, if she behaved herself
      properly, I would in all probability make her the present she coveted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;You must come again to-morrow,&rsquo; I said, as we shook hands, &lsquo;and I&rsquo;ll
      finish the thing off.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&rsquo; All right, master, I&rsquo;ll come.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And, with a nod and a bright smile, she walked away.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;During the whole of this interview, Tim had not been unobservant, and so
      soon as I was left alone he looked up from the work he was engaged upon,
      viz. potato-washing, and gave a knowing smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Sure she&rsquo;s a fine bold colleen,&rsquo; he said. &lsquo;Does your honour know who she
      is?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;I have not the slightest idea.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;They&rsquo;re saying down beyant that she&rsquo;s a say-fondling, and has neither
      father nor mother, nor any belongings.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Pray who was your informant?&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;The man who picked her from the say&mdash;William Jones hisself.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That name again. It was becoming too much for flesh and blood to bear.
      From the first moment of my arrival I had heard no other, and I had begun
      to detest its very sound.&rdquo;

    <h2>
      CHAPTER IV.&mdash;INTRODUCES WILLIAM JONES AND HIS FATHER.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">O</span>ur story is now
      bound to follow; in the footsteps of Matt, who, in quitting the presence
      of her artist-friend, walked rapidly along the sand-encumbered road in the
      direction of the sea.
    </p>
    <p>
      Skirting the lake upon the left hand, and still having the ocean of
      sand-hills upon her right, she gradually slackened her pace. A spectator,
      had he been by, would have doubtless observed that the change was owing to
      maiden meditation; that, in other words, Matt had fallen into a brown
      study.
    </p>
    <p>
      Presently she sat down upon a convenient stone, or piece of rock, and,
      resting her elbows on her knees, her chin in her hands, looked for some
      minutes at vacancy. At last she rose, flushing warmly, and murmuring
      something to herself.
    </p>
    <p>
      The something was to this effect:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;His hands are as white as a lady&rsquo;s when he pulls off them gloves, and he
      said I was as pretty as my picture.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      I can only guess at the train of reasoning which led to this soliloquy,
      and express my opinion that Matt had well-developed ideas on the subject
      of the sexes. True, she was not above sixteen, and had little or no
      experience of men, none at all of men who were both young and
      good-looking. Nevertheless, she was not insensible to the charms of a
      white hand, and other tokens of masculine refinement and beauty.
    </p>
    <p>
      By a natural sequence of ideas she was led to stretch out her own right
      hand and look at it critically. It was very brown, and covered with huge
      golden freckles. The inspection not being altogether satisfactory she
      thrust both her hands irritably into the pockets of her jacket, and walked
      on.
    </p>
    <p>
      Leaving the lake behind her, she followed the road along a swampy hollow,
      down which the very shallowest of rivulets crept along to the sea, now
      losing itself altogether in mossy patches of suspicious greenness, again
      emerging and trickling with feeble glimmers over pebble and sand.
      Presently she left the road and came upon a primitive wooden bridge,
      consisting of only one plank, supported on two cairns of stone. Here she
      paused, and, seeing a red-legged sand-piper running about on the edge of
      the water just below her, made a gesture like a boy&rsquo;s throwing a stone,
      whereon the sand-piper sprang up chirping, and flew along out of sight.
    </p>
    <p>
      By this time she was in full sight of the sea. Dead calm, and covered with
      rain-coloured shadows, it touched the edges of the flat sands about a mile
      away, and left one long creamy line of changeless foam.
    </p>
    <p>
      The sands themselves stretched away to the westward far as eye could see.
      But to the left and eastward, that is to say, in the direction towards
      which she was going, there was a long rocky promontory with signs of human
      habitation. Breaking into a swing-like trot, Matt hastened thither,
      following a footpath across marshy fields.
    </p>
    <p>
      In due time she came out upon a narrow and rudely made road which wound
      along the rocky promontory, at low water skirting the sand, at high water,
      the sea. The first house she reached was a wooden lifeboat house, lying
      down in a creek; and it being then low tide, at some distance from the
      water&rsquo;s edge. On the roadside above the house was a flagstaff, and beneath
      the flagstaff a wooden seat. All was very still and desolate, without a
      sign of life; but a little further along-the road was a row of cottages
      which seemed inhabited, and were, in fact, the abodes of the coastguard.
      Instead of lingering here Matt proceeded on her way until she reached,
      what, at first sight, looked like the beginning of a village, or small
      town. There were houses on each side of the road, some of them several
      stories high; but close inspection showed that most of them were roofless,
      that few of them possessed any windows or doors, and that nearly all were
      decayed and dilapidated from long disuse, while not a few had a blasted
      and sinister appearance, as if blackened by fire. And still there was no
      sign of any human soul. Suddenly, however, the street came to an end, and
      Matt found herself on a sort of rocky platform overlooking the sea; and on
      this platform, shading his eyes from the blazing sun, and looking out
      seaward, was a solitary man.
    </p>
    <p>
      So intent was he on his occupation that he was unconscious of Matt&rsquo;s
      approach till she was standing by his side. He turned his eyes upon her
      for a moment, and then once more gazed out to sea.
    </p>
    <p>
      A short, plump, thickset man, with a round, weather-beaten face, which
      would have been good-humoured but for its expression of extreme
      watchfulness and greed. The eyes were blue, but very small and keen; the
      forehead low and narrow; the hair coarse and sandy; the beard coarser and
      sandier still. He might have been about fifty years of age. His dress was
      curious: consisting of a yellow sou&rsquo;-wester, a pair of seaman&rsquo;s coarse
      canvas trousers, and a blue pilot jacket, ornamented with brass buttons
      which bore the insignia of Her Majesty&rsquo;s naval service.
    </p>
    <p>
      Presently, without turning his eyes again from the far distance, the man
      spoke in a husky, far-away whisper:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Matt, do you see summat out yonder?&rdquo; Matt strained her gaze through the
      dazzling sunlight, but failed to discern any object on the light expanse
      of water.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look ye now,&rdquo; continued the man; &ldquo;it may be drifting weed, or it may be
      wreck; but it&rsquo;s summat. Look again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Summat black, William Jones?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. Coming and going. Now it comes, and it&rsquo;s black; now it goes, and the
      water looks white where it was. If it isn&rsquo;t wreck, it&rsquo;s weed; if it ain&rsquo;t
      weed, it&rsquo;s wreck. And the tide&rsquo;s flowing, and it&rsquo;ll go ashore afore night
      at the Caldron Point, if I wait for it. But I shan&rsquo;t wait,&rdquo; he added
      eagerly. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go and overhaul it now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He looked round suspiciously, and then said, &ldquo;Matt, did you see any of
      them coastguard chaps as you come along?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, William Jones.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thought not. They&rsquo;re up Pencroes way, fooling about; so there&rsquo;s a chance
      for a honest man to look arter his living without no questioning. You come
      along with me, and if it <i>is</i> summat, I&rsquo;ll gie thee tuppence some o&rsquo;
      these fine days.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As he turned to go, his eye fell for the first time on her attire.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What&rsquo;s this, Matt? What are you doing in your Sunday clothes?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The girl was at a loss how to reply. She blushed scarlet and hung down her
      head. Fortunately for her the man was too absorbed in his main object of
      thought to catechize her further. He only shook his fat head in severe
      disapprobation, and led the way down to a small creek in the rocks, where
      a rough coble was rocking, secured by a rusty chain.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Jump in and take the paddles. I&rsquo;ll sit astarn and keep watch.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The girl obeyed and leapt in; but before sitting down she tucked up her
      dress to her knees to avoid the dirty water in the bottom of the boat.
      William Jones followed, and pushed off with his hands. Calm as the water
      was there was a heavy shoreward swell, on which they were immediately
      uplifted with some danger of being swept back on the rocks; but Matt
      handled the paddles like one to the manner born, and the boat shot out
      swiftly on the shining sea.
    </p>
    <p>
      The sun was burning with almost insufferable brightness, and the light
      blazed on the golden mirror of the water with blinding refracted rays.
      Crouching in the stern of the boat, William Jones shaded his eyes with
      both hands, and gazed intently on the object he had discovered far out to
      sea. Now and then he made a rapid motion to guide the girl in her rowing,
      but he did not speak a word.
    </p>
    <p>
      Oh, how hot it was out there on the sun-scorched waves! For some time Matt
      pulled on in silence, but at last she could bear it no longer, and rested
      on her oars, with the warm perspiration streaming down her freekled
      cheeks.&rsquo;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pull away, Matt,&rdquo; said the man, not looking at her. &ldquo;You ain&rsquo;t tired, not
      you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With a long-drawn breath Matt drew in the oars, and swift as thought
      peeled off her jacket and threw off her hat, leaving her head exposed to
      the burning sun.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now the silk gown she wore had evidently been used by its original owner
      as a festal raiment, for it had been cut low, and had short sleeves. So
      Matt&rsquo;s shoulders and arms were perfectly bare, and very white they looked
      in contrast with her sun-freckled hands, her sunburnt face, and her warm
      brown neck. Her bust was as yet undeveloped, but her neck and shoulders
      were fine, and her arms beautifully moulded. Altogether, her friend the
      painter, could he have seen her just then, would have regarded her with
      increasing admiration.
    </p>
    <p>
      Freed from the encumbrance of her jacket, she now pulled away with easy
      grace and skill. Further and further the boat receded from shore, till the
      promontory they had left was a couple of miles away. Suddenly William
      Jones made a sign to the girl to stop, and stood up in the boat to
      reconnoitre.
    </p>
    <p>
      The object at which he had been gazing so long was now clearly visible. It
      consisted of something black, floating on a glassy stretch of water, and
      surrounded by fragments of loose scum or foam; it was to all appearance
      motionless, but was in reality drifting wearily shoreward on the flowing
      tide.
    </p>
    <p>
      William Jones now evinced increasing excitement, and urged his companion
      to hurry quickly forward&mdash;which she did, putting out all her strength
      in a series of rapid and powerful strokes. Another quarter of an hour
      brought them to the spot where the object was floating. Trembling with
      eagerness, the man leant over the boat&rsquo;s side with outstretched hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      As he did so Matt turned her head away with a curious gesture of dread.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is it, William Jones?&rdquo; she asked, not looking at him. &ldquo;It isn&rsquo;t&mdash;you
      know&mdash;one o&rsquo; <i>them?</i>&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, it ain&rsquo;t!&rdquo; replied the man, leaning over the side of the coble, and
      tilting the gunwale almost to the water&rsquo;s edge; &ldquo;Too early for <i>them</i>,
      Matt. If they comes, it won&rsquo;t be till Sunday&rsquo;s tide. They&rsquo;re down at the
      bottom now, and ain&rsquo;t yet rose. Easy! Lean t&rsquo;other way! So there&mdash;look
      out!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As he spoke he struggled with something in the water, and at last, with an
      effort which almost capsized the boat, pulled it in. Matt looked now, and
      saw that it was a small flat wooden trunk, covered with pieces of slimy
      weed. Floating near it were several pieces of splintered wood which seemed
      to have formed part of a boat. These, too, William secured, and threw down
      on the foot-board beneath him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a box, that&rsquo;s what it is,&rdquo; cried Matt.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a box, surely,&rdquo; said Jones. &ldquo;And it&rsquo;s locked, too. And look ye now.
      I misdoubt there&rsquo;s nowt inside, or mayhap it would have sunk, Howsomever,
      we&rsquo;ll see!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      After an unavailing effort to force it open with his hands, he drew forth
      a large clasp-knife, worked away at the lock, and tried to force open the
      lid, which soon yielded to his efforts, as the action of the salt water
      had already begun to rot the wood. On being thus opened, the box was found
      to contain only a couple of coarse linen shirts, an old newspaper, two or
      three biscuits, and half a bottle of some dark fluid.
    </p>
    <p>
      After examining these articles one by one, William Jones threw them back
      into the box with gestures of disgust, retaining only the bottle, which he
      uncorked and applied to his lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Rum!&rdquo; he said, smacking his lips and nodding at Matt. Then re-corking the
      bottle carefully he returned it to the box, and standing up, reconnoitred
      the sea on every side. But nothing else rewarded his eager search; he
      threw himself down in the stem of the boat, and ordered Matt to pull back
      to shore.
    </p>
    <p>
      As they went he closed one eye thoughtfully, and mused aloud: &ldquo;Night afore
      last it blew half a gale from the south&rsquo;ard. This here box came awash from
      the east coast of Ireland. Maybe it was a big ship as was lost; them
      planks was part of a wessel&rsquo;s long boat. More&rsquo;s coming if the wind don&rsquo;t
      come up from the norrard. The moon&rsquo;s full to-night and to-morrow. I&rsquo;ll
      tell the old &rsquo;un, and keep a sharp, look-out off the Caldron Pint.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Matt rowed on steadily till they came within a quarter of a mile of the
      shore, when William Jones stood up again and reconnoitred the prospect
      inland.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pull in, Matt!&rdquo; he said, after a minute. &ldquo;All&rsquo;s square!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Soon afterwards the boat reached the rocks.. William Jones sprang out, and
      running up to the platform above, took another survey. This being
      satisfactory, he ran down again and lifted the box out of the boat,
      carrying it with ease under one arm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Make the boat fast,&rdquo; he said in a husky whisper, &ldquo;and bring them bits o&rsquo;
      wood along with you for the fire. I&rsquo;ll cut on to the cottage with this
      here. It ain&rsquo;t much, but it&rsquo;s summat; so I&rsquo;ll carry it clean out o&rsquo; sight
      before them precious coastguards come smelling about.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With these words he clambered up the rocks with his burthen, leaving Matt
      to follow leisurely in his wake.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER V.&mdash;CONCLUDES WITH A KISS.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">N</span>ot far from the
      spot where William Jones had landed, and removed some little distance from
      the deserted village with its desolate main street and roofless
      habitations, there stood a low one-storied cottage, quite as black and
      forbidding-looking as any of the abandoned dwellings in its vicinity. It
      was built of stone, and roofed with slate, but the doorway was composed of
      old ship&rsquo;s timber, and the one small window it contained had originally
      formed the window of a ship&rsquo;s cabin. Over the door was placed, like a
      sign, the wooden figure-head of a young woman, naked to the waist, holding
      a mirror in her hand, and regarding herself with remarkable complacency,
      despite the fact that accident had deprived her of a nose and one eye, and
      that the beautiful red complexion and jet black hair she had once
      possessed had been entirely washed away by the action of the elements,
      leaving her all over of a leprous pallor. The rest of the building, as I
      have suggested, was of sinister blackness, though here and there it was
      sprinkled with wet sea sand. Sand, too, lay on every side, covered a small
      patch, originally meant for a garden, and drifted thickly up to the very
      door.
    </p>
    <p>
      To this cottage William Jones ran with his treasure trove, and, entering
      in without ceremony, found himself in almost total darkness&mdash;for the
      light which crept through the blackened panes of the small windows was
      only just sufficient to make darkness visible. But this worthy seaside
      character, having, in addition to a cat&rsquo;s predatory instincts, something
      of a cat&rsquo;s power of vision, clearly discerned everything in the chamber he
      just entered&mdash;a rude stone-paved kitchen, with an open fireplace, and
      no grate, black rafters overhead, from which were hung sundry lean pieces
      of bacon, a couple of wooden chairs, a table, and in one corner a sort of
      bed in the wall, where a human figure was reposing. Setting down the trunk
      on the floor, he marched right over to the bed, and unceremoniously shook
      the individual lying upon it, whom he discovered to be snoring and
      muttering in a heavy sleep. Finding that he did not wake with shaking,
      William Jones bent down and cried lustily in his ear&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wreck! wreck ashore!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The effect was instantaneous. The figure rose up in bed, disclosing the
      head and shoulders of a very old man, who wore a red cotton nightcap, and
      whose hair and beard were as white as snow.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Eh? Wheer? Wheer?&rdquo; he cried in a shrill treble, looking vacantly around
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wake up, old &rsquo;un!&rdquo; said William, seizing him, and shaking him
      again. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s me, William Jones.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;William? Is it my son William?&rdquo; returned the old man, peering out into
      the darkness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, father. Look ye now, you was a-talking again in your sleep, you was.
      A good thing no one heerd you but your son William. Some o&rsquo; these days
      you&rsquo;ll be letting summat out, you will, if you go on like this.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The old man shook his head feebly, then clasping his hands together in a
      kind of rapture, he looked at his son, and said&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, William, I was a-dreaming. Oh, it was such a heavingly dream! I was
      a-standing on the shore, William, and it was a-blowing hard from the east,
      and all at once I see a ship as big as an Indiaman, come in wi&rsquo; all sail
      set, and go ashore; and I looked round, William dear, and there was no one
      nigh but you and me; and when she broke up, I see gold and silver and
      jewels come washing ashore just like floating weeds, and the drownded,
      every one of &rsquo;em, had rings on their fingers, and gold watches and
      cheens, and more&rsquo;n that, that their hands was full of shining gold; and
      one on &rsquo;em&mdash;a lady, William&mdash;had a bright dimond ring, as
      big as a walnut; but when I tried to pull it off, it wouldn&rsquo;t come&mdash;and
      just as I pulled out my leetle knife to cut the finger off, and put it in
      my pocket, you shook me, William, and woke me up. Oh! it was a heavingly
      dream!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      William Jones had listened with ill-disguised interest to the early part
      of this speech, but on its conclusion, he gave another grunt of
      undissembled disgust.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, you&rsquo;re awake now, old &rsquo;un, so jump up. I&rsquo;ve brought summat
      home. Look sharp, and get a light.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Thereupon the old man, who was fully dressed, in a pair of old woollen
      trousers and a guernsey, slipped from the bed, and began fumbling about
      the room. He soon found what he wanted&mdash;a box of matches and a rude
      home-made candle, fashioned of a long, coarse reed dipped in sheep&rsquo;s
      tallow, but owing to the fact that he was exceedingly feeble and
      tremulous, he was so long in lighting up that his gentle son grew
      impatient.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here, give &rsquo;un to me!&rdquo; said William. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re wasting them matches
      just as if they cost nowt. A precious father <i>you</i> are, and no
      mistake.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The candle being lit and burning with a feeble flame, he informed the old
      man of what he had found. In a moment the latter was down on his knees,
      opening the box, and greedily examining its contents. But William pushed
      him impatiently away, and closed the lid with a bang.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Theer, enough o&rsquo; that, old &rsquo;un! You hold the light while I carry
      the box in and put it away.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right, William dear; all right,&rdquo; returned the old man, obeying
      gleefully. &ldquo;I know&rsquo;d we should have luck, by that beautiful dream.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The two men&mdash;one holding the light and the other carrying the trunk&mdash;passed
      through a door at the back of the kitchen and entered an inner chamber.
      This chamber, too, contained a window, which was so blocked up however by
      lumber of all kinds that little or no daylight entered. Piled up in great
      confusion were old sacks, some partly full, some empty, coils of rope,
      broken oars, broken fragments of ships&rsquo; planks, rotten and barnacled, a
      small boat&rsquo;s rudder, dirty sails, several oilskin coats, bits of iron
      ballast, and other flotsam and jetsam; so that the chamber had a salt and
      fish-like smell, suggesting the hold of some vessel. But in one corner of
      the room was a small wooden bed, with a mattrass and coarse bed-clothing,
      and hanging on a nail close to it was certain feminine attire which the
      owner of the caravan would have recognized as the garb worn by Matt on the
      morning of her first appearance.
    </p>
    <p>
      Placing the box down, William Jones carefully covered it with a portion of
      an old sail.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s summat, but it ain&rsquo;t much,&rdquo; he muttered discontentedly. &ldquo;Lucky them
      coastguards didn&rsquo;t see me come ashore. If they did, though, it wouldn&rsquo;t
      signify; for what&rsquo;s floating on the sea belongs to him as finds it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A sound startled him as he spoke, and looking round suspiciously he saw
      Matt entering the room, loaded with broken wood. But she was not alone;
      standing behind her in the shadow was a man&mdash;none other, indeed, than
      Monk of Monkshurst.
    </p>
    <p>
      While Matt entered the room to throw down her load of wood Monk stood in
      the doorway. His quick eye had noted the movements of father and son.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;More plunder, William Jones?&rdquo; he asked grimly.
    </p>
    <p>
      In a moment William Jones was transformed. The keen expression of his face
      changed to one of mingled stupidity and sadness; he began to whine.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;More plunder, Mr. Monk?&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;no, no; the days for finding that is
      gone. Matt and me has been on the shore foraging for a bit o&rsquo; firewood,&mdash;that
      be all. Put it down, Matt; put it down.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Matt did as she was told: opening her arms, she threw her load into a
      corner of the room; then William Jones hurried the whole party back into
      the kitchen.
    </p>
    <p>
      The men seated themselves on benches; but Matt moved about the room to get
      a light. The light as well as everything else was a living illustration of
      the meanness ol William Jones. It consisted, not of a candle, but of a
      long rush, which had been gathered from the marshes by Matt, and
      afterwards dried and dipped in grease by William Jones. Matt lit it, and
      fixed it in a little iron niche which was evidently made for the purpose
      and which was attached to a table near the hearth. When the work was
      finished she threw off her hat and jacket, retired to the further end of
      the hearth, and sat down on the floor.
    </p>
    <p>
      During the whole of this time Mr. Monk had been watching her gloomily; and
      he had been watched in his turn by William Jones. At last the latter
      spoke.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Matt&rsquo;s growed,&rdquo; said he; &ldquo;she&rsquo;s growed wonderful. Lord bless us! she&rsquo;s a
      bit changed, she is, sin&rsquo; that night when you found her down on the shore.
      Why, her own friends wouldn&rsquo;t know her!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Monk started and frowned.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Her friends?&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;what friends?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, them as owns her,&rdquo; continued William Jones; &ldquo;if they wasn&rsquo;t all
      drownded in the ship what she came ashore from, they must be somewheer.
      Mayhap some day they&rsquo;ll find her, and reward me for bringin&rsquo; her up a good
      gal,&mdash;that&rsquo;s what I allus tell her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So that&rsquo;s what you always tell her, do you?&rdquo; returned Monk grimly. &ldquo;Then
      you&rsquo;re a fool for your pains. The girl&rsquo;s got no friends&mdash;haven&rsquo;t I
      told you that before?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly you have, Mr. Monk,&rdquo; returned William Jones meekly; &ldquo;but look
      ye now, I think&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;ve no right to think,&rdquo; thundered Monk; &ldquo;you&rsquo;re not paid for thinking;
      you&rsquo;re paid for keeping the girl, and what more do you want?&mdash;Matt,&rdquo;
       he continued in a softer tone, &ldquo;come to me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But Matt didn&rsquo;t hear&mdash;or, at any rate, did not heed; for she made no
      movement. Then Monk, gazing intently at her, gave vent to the same remark
      as William Jones had done a few hours before.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where have you been to-day,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;to have on that frock?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Again Matt hung her head and was silent. Monk repeated his question; and
      seeing that he was determined to have an answer, she threw up her head
      defiantly and said, with a tone of pride in her voice&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I put it on to be took!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To be took?&rdquo; repeated Monk.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; returned Matt; &ldquo;to have my likeness took. There be a painter chap
      here that lives in a cart; he&rsquo;s took it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was curious to note the changes in Mr. Monk&rsquo;s face: at first he tried
      to appear amiable; then his face gradually darkened into a look of angry
      suspicion.
    </p>
    <p>
      Matt never once withdrew her eyes from him&mdash;his very presence seemed
      to rouse all that was bad in her&mdash;and she glared at him through her
      tangled locks in much the same manner that a shaggy terrier puppy might
      gaze at a bull which it would fain attack, but feared on account of its
      superior strength.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Matt,&rdquo; said Mr. Monk again, &ldquo;come here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This time she obeyed; she rose slowly from her seat and went reluctantly
      to his side.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Matt, look me in the face,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;do you know who this painter is?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Matt shook her head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How many times have you seen him?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Twice.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And what has he said to you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A lot o&rsquo; things.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell me one thing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He asked me who my mother was, and I told him I hadn&rsquo;t got none.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Monk&rsquo;s face once more grew black as night.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;poking and prying and asking questions. I thought as much.
      He&rsquo;s a scoundrelly vagabond!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, he ain&rsquo;t,&rdquo; said Matt bluntly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Matt, my girl,&rdquo; said Mr. Monk, taking no notice of her interruption, &ldquo;I
      want you to promise me something.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not to go near that painter again!&rdquo; Matt shook her head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shan&rsquo;t promise,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;&rsquo;cause I shall go. My likeness ain&rsquo;t
      took yet&mdash;he takes a time, he does. I&rsquo;m going to put them things on
      to-morrow and be took again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      For a moment the light in his eyes looked dangerous, then he smiled and
      patted her cheek, at which caress she shrank away. &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter?&rdquo; he
      asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing,&rdquo; said Matt. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t like to be pulled about, that&rsquo;s all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You mean you don&rsquo;t like <i>me?</i>&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t know. That&rsquo;s telling.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And yet you&rsquo;ve no cause to hate me, Matt, for I&rsquo;ve been a good friend to
      you&mdash;and always shall, because I like you, Matt. Do you understand? I
      like you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So anxious did he seem to impress this upon her, that he put his arm
      around her waist, drew her towards him, and kissed her on the cheek, a
      ceremony he had never performed before. But Matt seemed by no means to
      appreciate the honour; as his lips touched her cheeks she shivered; and
      when he released her she began rubbing at the place as if to wipe the
      touch away.
    </p>
    <p>
      If Mr. Monk noticed this action on the part of the girl he deemed it
      prudent to take no notice of it. He said a few more pleasant things to
      Matt, and again patted her cheek affectionately, then he left the cottage,
      taking William Jones with him. Ten minutes later William Jones returned
      alone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where&rsquo;s <i>he?</i>&rdquo; asked Matt.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Meanin&rsquo; Mr. Monk, Matt&mdash;he be gone!&rdquo; said William Jones.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gone for good?&rdquo; demanded Matt, impatiently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; he ain&rsquo;t, Matt. He&rsquo;ll be down here to-morrow, he will; and you&rsquo;d best
      be at home!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Matt said nothing this time; she only turned away sullenly and shrugged
      her shoulders.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Matt,&rdquo; said William Jones, presently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Monk seems uncommon fond of you, he do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Matt reflected for a moment, then she replied&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wonder what he&rsquo;s fond o&rsquo; me for, William Jones?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I dunno&mdash;&lsquo;cause he is, I suppose,&rdquo; returned William Jones,
      having no more logical answer at his command.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Tain&rsquo;t that,&rdquo; said Matt; &ldquo;he don&rsquo;t love me &rsquo;cause I&rsquo;m <i>me</i>,
      William Jones. There&rsquo;s somethin&rsquo; else, and I should just like to know what
      that somethin&rsquo; is, I should.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      William Jones looked at her, conscious that there was a new development of
      sagacity in her character, but was utterly at a loss to understand what
      that new development meant.

      CHAPTER VI.&mdash;ALSO CONCLUDES WITH A KISS.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">W</span>hen Matt awoke the
      next morning, the first thing she did was to look around for her Sunday
      clothes, which on retiring to rest she had carefully placed beside her
      bed. They were gone, and in their place lay the habiliments she was
      accustomed to wear on her erratic pilgrimages every day.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her face grew cloudy, she hunted all round the chamber, but finding
      nothing that she sought she was compelled to array herself as she best
      could.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;William Jones,&rdquo; she said, when she sat with that worthy at a hermit&rsquo;s
      breakfast of dry bread and whey, &ldquo;where&rsquo;s my Sunday clothes?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      William Jones fidgeted a bit, then he said&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They&rsquo;re put where you won&rsquo;t find &rsquo;em. Look ye now, Matt, you&rsquo;d
      better be doin&rsquo; summat more useful than runnin&rsquo; about after a painter
      chap. I was down on the shore this morning, and I seen heaps o&rsquo; wood&mdash;you&rsquo;d
      best get some of it afore night!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Matt gave a snort, but said nothing. A few minutes later her benign
      protector left the cottage, and a little after he had disappeared Matt
      issued forth; but instead of beating the shore for firewood, as she had
      been told to do, she ran across the fields to the painter.
    </p>
    <p>
      She found him already established at his work. The fact was he had been
      for some time strolling about with his hands in his pockets, and scanning
      the prospect on every side, for a sight of her. Having got tired of this
      characteristic occupation, he at length sat down and began to put a few
      touches to the portrait. Seeing that he was unconscious of her approach,
      Matt crept up quietly behind him and took a peep at the picture.
    </p>
    <p>
      Her black eyes dilated with pleasure.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, ain&rsquo;t it beautiful!&rdquo; she exclaimed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So you have come at last,&rdquo; said Brinkley quietly, going on with his
      painting.
    </p>
    <p>
      She made no movement and no further sound, so he continued&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps now you <i>have</i> come you&rsquo;ll be good enough to step round that
      I may continue my work. I am longing to refresh my memory with a sight of
      your face, Matt!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, you can&rsquo;t,&rdquo; said Matt; &ldquo;they&rsquo;re locked up!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Eh! what&rsquo;s locked up&mdash;my memory or your face?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was clear Matt could not appreciate banter. She saw him smile, and
      guessed that he was laughing at her, and her face grew black and mutinous.
      She would have slunk off, but his voice stopped her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come here, Matt,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be silly, child; tell me what&rsquo;s the
      matter, and&mdash;why, what has become of your resplendent raiment&mdash;your
      gorgeous Sunday clothes?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Didn&rsquo;t I tell yer?&mdash;they&rsquo;re locked up.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, William Jones done it &rsquo;cause <i>he</i> told him. <i>He</i>
      don&rsquo;t want me to come here and be took.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! Tell you what it is, Matt, we will have our own way, in spite of
      them. For the present this picture shall be put aside. If in a day or so
      you can again don your Sunday raiment, and sit to me again in them&mdash;if
      not, I dare say I shall be able to finish the dress from memory. That
      portrait I shall give to you. In the mean time, as I want one for myself,
      I will paint you as you are. Do you approve?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Matt nodded her head vigorously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well,&rdquo; said Brinkley. &ldquo;Then we will get on.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He removed from his easel and carefully covered the portrait upon which he
      had been working. Then he put up a fresh cardboard and sat down, inviting
      Matt to do the same.
    </p>
    <p>
      With the disappearance of the Sunday clothes the girl&rsquo;s stiffness seemed
      to have disappeared also, and she became again a veritable child of
      Nature. She looked like a shaggy young pony fresh from a race on the
      mountain side as she threw herself on the ground in an attitude which was
      all picturesqueness and beauty. Then with her plump sunburnt hand she
      carelessly began to pull up the grass, while her black eyes searched
      alternately the prospect and the painter&rsquo;s face.
    </p>
    <p>
      Presently she spoke.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>He</i> says you&rsquo;re a pryin&rsquo; scoundrel,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Brinkley looked up and smiled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who is <i>he</i>, Matt?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Monk,&rdquo; she replied, and gave a jerk with her head in the direction of
      Monkshurst.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, indeed,&rdquo; said Brinkley. &ldquo;It is my amiable equestrian friend, is it?
      I&rsquo;m sure I&rsquo;m much obliged to him. And when, may I ask, did he bore you
      with his opinion of me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Last night, when he come to see William Jones. He said I wasn&rsquo;t to be
      took no more, &lsquo;cause you was a scoundrel poking and prying.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Brinkley began to whistle, and went on for a while vigorously touching up
      his work. Then he looked up and regarded the girl curiously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Monk seems to be very much interested in <i>you</i>, Matt?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The girl nodded her head vigorously; then remembering the odious caress to
      which Mr. Monk had subjected her, she began to rub her cheek again
      violently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why is Mr. Monk so interested in you? Do you know?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;P&rsquo;raps it&rsquo;s &rsquo;cause he found me when I come ashore?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, <i>he</i> found you, did he? Then why doesn&rsquo;t he keep you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He do, only I live along o&rsquo; William Jones.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Again Brinkley began whistling lightly, and working away vigorously with
      his brush. Presently the conversation began again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Matt, what things did you come ashore in?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I dunno!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have never heard whether anything was found with you which might lead
      to your finding your relations?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no more has William Jones. He says maybe they&rsquo;ll find me some day and
      reward him; but Mr. Monk says they were all drownded, and I ain&rsquo;t got no
      friends &rsquo;cept him and William Jones.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, since he found you, I suppose he ought to know; and since you <i>have</i>
      no relations, Matt, and no claim upon anybody in the world, it was very
      kind of Mr. Monk to keep you, instead of sending you to the workhouse as
      he might have done.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      On this point Matt seemed rather sceptical.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; continued Brinkley, as he went on lightly touching up his work,
      &ldquo;perhaps I have done my equestrian friend a wrong. Perhaps his unamiable
      exterior belies his real nature; perhaps he is good and kind, generous to
      the poor, willing to help the helpless&mdash;like you, for instance.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is it him?&rdquo; exclaimed Matt, &ldquo;Monk of Monkshurst! Why, he don&rsquo;t give
      nothin&rsquo; to nobody. No fear.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And yet, according to your own showing, he has helped to support you all
      these years&mdash;you, who have no claim whatever upon him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This was an enigma to which Matt had no solution. She said no more, but
      Brinkley, while he continued his painting, silently ruminated thus:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It strikes me this puzzle would be worth unravelling if I could only find
      the key. Query, is the young person the key, if I but knew how to use her?
      Perhaps, since the amiable Monk evidently dislikes my coming into
      communication with her. But it would be useless to lay the case before
      her, since, if she is the key, she is quite unconscious of it herself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He threw down his brush, rose and stretched himself, and said&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look here, Matt, I&rsquo;m tired of work. The sun shining on those sand-hills
      and on the far-off sea is too tempting. I shall go for a walk, and you, if
      you are in the mood, shall be my guide.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She evidently was in the mood, for she was on her feet in an instant.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right, master,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll go.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well.&mdash;Tim, bring forth some refreshment. We will refresh the
      inner man and girl before we start.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Tim disappeared into the caravan. Presently he re-appeared bearing a small
      tray, on which was a small flask of brandy, a large jug of milk, some
      biscuits, and a couple of glasses. This he placed on the camp stool, which
      his master had just, vacated, and which, when not in use as a seat, served
      as a table. Brinkley poured out two glasses of milk, then, looking at
      Matt, he held the little flask on high.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Brandy, Matt?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She shook her head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well, child; I think you are wise. Here, take the milk and drink
      confusion to your enemies!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Matt took the glass of milk and drank it down, while Brinkley hastened to
      dilute and dispose of the other. Then he gave some orders to Tim, and they
      started off. As they had no particular object in view, they chose the
      pleasantest route, and clearly the pleasantest lay across the sand-hills.
      Not because the sand-hills were pleasant in themselves; they were not,
      especially on a day when the sun was scorching the roads and making the
      sea like a mill-pond; but because by crossing the sand-hills one came on
      the other side upon a footpath which led, by various windings, gradually
      to the top of breezy cliffs.
    </p>
    <p>
      To the sand-hills, therefore, they wended their way. Having gained them
      they followed a route which Matt knew full well, and which soon brought
      them to the narrow footpath beyond. During the walk she was singularly
      silent, and Brinkley seemed to be busily trying to work out some abstruse
      problem which had taken possession of his brain.
    </p>
    <p>
      When they had followed the footpath for some distance, and had gained the
      greensward on the top of the cliffs, the young man threw himself upon the
      grass, and invited Matt to do the same. It was very pleasant there,
      soothing both to the eye and to the mind. The cliff was covered&mdash;somewhat
      sparsely, it is true&mdash;with stunted grass, and just below on their
      right lay the ocean, calm as any mill-pond, but sighing softly as the
      water kissed the rocks and flowed back again with rhythmic throbs. On
      their left lay the sand-hills, glittering like dusty gold in the sun rays,
      while just before and below them was the village.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you see that house standing all by itself, close to shore?&rdquo; said Matt,
      pointing to the cottage where she lived; &ldquo;that belongs to William Jones&mdash;and
      look ye now, there be William Jones on the rocks!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Looking down, Brinkley beheld a figure moving along the rocks, just where
      the water touched the edge.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very lazy of William Jones,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Why isn&rsquo;t he at work?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At work?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes; tilling the fields or fishing. By the way, I forgot to ask you, is
      he a fisherman?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, he ain&rsquo;t,&rdquo; said Matt &ldquo;He&rsquo;s a wrecker, he is!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A what?&rdquo; exclaimed Brinkley.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A wrecker,&rdquo; continued Matt, as if wrecking was the most natural
      occupation in the world.
    </p>
    <p>
      Brinkley looked, at her, imagining that she must be practising some wild
      joke. He had certainly heard of wreckers, but he had always believed that
      they were a species of humanity which had belonged to past centuries, and
      were now as extinct as a mammoth. But the girl evidently meant what she
      said, and thought there was nothing extraordinary in the statement.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That sea don&rsquo;t look ugly, do it?&rdquo; she continued, pointing at the ocean,
      &ldquo;but it is&mdash;there&rsquo;s rocks out there where the ships split on, then
      they go all to pieces, and the things come ashore.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And what becomes of all the things, Matt?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Some of &rsquo;em&rsquo;s stole and some of &rsquo;em&rsquo;s took by the
      coastguards. They do say,&rdquo; she added, mysteriously, &ldquo;as there&rsquo;s lots o&rsquo;
      things&mdash;gold and silver&mdash;hid among them sand-hills. Before the
      coastguards come all the folk was wreckers like William Jones, and they
      used to get what come ashore, and they used to hide it in the sand-hills.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed! Then if that is the case, why don&rsquo;t they take the treasure up,
      and turn it into money?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why? &rsquo;Cause they can&rsquo;t; them sandhills is allus changing and shifting
      about, they are; though they know well enough the things is there, there&rsquo;s
      no findin&rsquo; of &rsquo;em!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I always thought William Jones was poor?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So he is, he says!&rdquo; replied Matt, &ldquo;&rsquo;cause though he be allus
      foraging, he don&rsquo;t find much now on account o&rsquo; them coastguard chaps.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      After they had rested themselves, they went a little further up the cliff,
      then they followed a narrow winding path, which brought them to the shore
      below. Here Matt, who seemed to be pretty well grounded in the history of
      the place, pointed him out the wonders of the coast.
    </p>
    <p>
      She showed him the caves, which tradition said had been formerly used as
      wreckers&rsquo; haunts and treasure stores, but which were now washed by the
      sea, and covered with slimy weeds; then she brought him to a promontory
      where they told her she herself had been found. This spot Brinkley
      examined curiously, then he looked at the girl.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose you had clothes on when you came ashore, didn&rsquo;t you, Matt?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, of course, I had. William Jones has got &rsquo;em!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Has he? Where?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In his cave, I expect.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;His cave! Where is that?&rdquo; asked Brinkley, becoming very much interested.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dunno,&rdquo; returned Matt; &ldquo;perhaps it&rsquo;s somewhere hereabout. I&rsquo;ve seen
      William Jones come about here, I have, but I never could track him!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Matt&rsquo;s information on the subject was so vague that it seemed useless to
      institute a search; so, after a regretful look at the rocks, Brinkley
      proposed that they should saunter back along the shore.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By the way,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;I want you to introduce me to William Jones.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To William Jones?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. Strange as the fancy may seem to you, I should like for once in my
      life to stand face to face with a real live wrecker.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They made their way back along the coast, until they reached William
      Jones&rsquo;s cottage. Here they paused, principally for Brinkley to take a
      glance at the quaint dwelling, then they crossed the threshold. What sort
      of a place he had got into, it was utterly impossible for Brinkley to
      tell; it was so dark, he could see nothing. Having crossed the threshold,
      therefore, he paused; but Matt went fearlessly forward, struck a light,
      and ignited the rushlight on the table.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;William Jones,&rdquo; said she, &ldquo;here be the painter!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      By the light of the flickering rushlight Brinkley now looked about him. At
      a glance he noted some of the details of the queer little room, then his
      eye fell upon the occupants, whom, from Matt&rsquo;s description, he recognized
      as William Jones and the grizzly author of his being.
    </p>
    <p>
      The old man, who Brinkley perforce admitted certainly bore some
      resemblance to the Rembrandtish head which Matt had recognized, sat dozing
      fitfully by the hearth, while his son was busily employed in mending an
      old lantern.
    </p>
    <p>
      Upon the entrance of Brinkley, the lantern was quickly thrown aside, and
      William Jones, assuming a most obsequious manner, hastened to give a
      welcome to the stranger. Brinkley was amused. He accepted William Jones&rsquo;s
      offer of a seat, then he lit up his briar-root pipe, and while smoking
      lazily, he put a few questions to his host. But if he expected to gain
      information of any kind he was soon undeceived. William Jones was no fool.
      Combined with excessive avarice, he possessed all the cunning of the fox,
      and the moment he saw that the stranger was pumping him, he was on his
      guard.
    </p>
    <p>
      Presently, however, his curiosity gained the day. Categorically, in his
      turn, he began to question Brinkley about his doings.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose now, master,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;you travel about a deal i&rsquo; that cart o&rsquo;
      your&rsquo;n?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Brinkley explained that the &ldquo;cart&rdquo; in question had been in his possession
      only a few months.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I travelled a good deal before I got it,&rdquo; he explained. &ldquo;This time
      last year I was in Ireland.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In Ireland, master?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, on the west coast; do you know it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      William Jones shook his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There be plenty wreck there, ain&rsquo;t there?&rdquo; said he suddenly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wreck?&rdquo; repeated Brinkley.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I&rsquo;ve heard tell o&rsquo; wonderful storms and big ships breaking up. Look
      ye, now, they do tell wonderful stories; and I wonder sometimes if all
      they says be true.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Brinkley looked at his host for a minute or so in silent wonder, for the
      little man was transformed. Instead of gazing about him with the stupid
      expression which up till now his face had worn, his face expressed all the
      keenness of a foxhound well on the scent. There was also another curious
      thing which the young man noticed, that the word &ldquo;wreck&rdquo; seemed to act
      like magic on the other member of the Jones&rsquo; household. At the first
      mention of it the old man started from his sleep; and he now sat staring
      wildly before him, evidently imagining he was standing on a headland,
      gazing out to sea.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wreck!&rdquo; he murmured; &ldquo;ay, there it be, driftin&rsquo; in wi&rsquo; the wind and the
      tide, William; driftin&rsquo; in wi&rsquo; the tide.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shut up, old man,&rdquo; said William, giving his father a nudge; then turning
      again to Brinkley, he said, &ldquo;Be them tales true, master?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Eh?&mdash;Oh yes; perfectly true,&rdquo; said Brinkley, being in a lively
      humour, and determined to give his host a treat.
    </p>
    <p>
      The expression in the eyes of William Jones became even more greedy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;P&rsquo;raps,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;you&rsquo;ve seen some of them wrecks.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dear me, yes,&rdquo; answered Brinkley, determined to give the reins to his
      imagination. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve seen any number of them. Huge ships broken up like
      match-boxes, and every soul on board them drowned; then afterwards&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah yes, master,&rdquo; said William Jones eagerly as the other paused; &ldquo;arter&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, afterwards, my friend, I&rsquo;ve seen treasures come ashore that would
      have made you and me, and a dozen others such, men for life.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dear, dear! and what became of it, master&mdash;tell me that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What became of it?&rdquo; repeated Brinkley, whose imagination was beginning to
      give way; &ldquo;why, it was appropriated, of course, by the population.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And didn&rsquo;t you take your share, master?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I?&rdquo; repeated Brinkley, who was getting muddled; &ldquo;well, firstly, because I
      didn&rsquo;t wish to&mdash;I have a superstitious horror of wearing dead men&rsquo;s
      things; and secondly, because I could not have done so had I wished. The
      people are clannish; they wanted it all for themselves, and would have
      killed any interfering stranger.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose, master, there be no coastguard chaps <i>there?</i>&rdquo; said
      William Jones.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh dear, no! No coastguards.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; sighed the old man, coming out of his trance. &ldquo;It warn&rsquo;t so long ago
      when there warn&rsquo;t no coastguard chaps <i>here</i> neither. Then times was
      better for honest men. On a dark night &rsquo;twas easy to put a light on
      the headland, and sometimes we got a prize or two that way, didn&rsquo;t we,
      William dear; but now&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You shut up!&rdquo; roared William, giving his parent a very forcible dig in
      the ribs. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t know what you&rsquo;re talkin&rsquo; about, you don&rsquo;t.&mdash;The
      old &rsquo;un is a bit queer in the head, master,&rdquo; he explained; &ldquo;and
      he&rsquo;s allus a dreamin&rsquo;, he is. There ain&rsquo;t no prizes here, the Lord knows;
      it&rsquo;s a&rsquo;most as much as we can do to git a bit o&rsquo; bread. Matt knows that;
      don&rsquo;t ee&rsquo;, Matt?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But whatever Matt knew she evidently meant to keep to herself, for she
      gave no reply. Presently, after a little more general conversation,
      Brinkley rose to go. He offered a two-shilling piece to William Jones; and
      somewhat to his amazement, that worthy accepted it gratefully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good-bye, Matt,&rdquo; said Brinkley. But in a trice Matt was beside him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m going to show you the way,&rdquo; she explained as she went out with him
      into the air.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Whew!&rdquo; said Brinkley when they were fairly clear of the cabin; &ldquo;the open
      air is better than that den; but then William Jones is very poor, isn&rsquo;t
      he, Matt?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He <i>says</i> he is.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But don&rsquo;t you believe it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;P&rsquo;raps I do, and p&rsquo;raps I don&rsquo;t; it don&rsquo;t matter to you, does it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not the least in the world.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They went on for a while in silence; then Matt, who had been furtively
      watching his face all the while, spoke again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You ain&rsquo;t angry, are you, master?&rdquo; she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I angry?&mdash;what for?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Cause I said that just now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dear me, no; whatever <i>you</i> might say, Matt, wouldn&rsquo;t offend me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      If he expected to please her by this he was mistaken.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s &rsquo;cause you don&rsquo;t care. Well, I don&rsquo;t care neither, if <i>you</i>
      don&rsquo;t.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She ran a little ahead of him, and continued to precede him until she
      gained the last sand-hill, and caught a glimpse of the caravan. Then she
      paused.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t want me to go no further, do you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right&mdash;good-bye.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She gave a bound, like a young deer, and prepared to start for a swift run
      back, but the young man called her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Matt, come here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She came up to him. He put his arm about her shoulders, bent over her
      upturned face, and kissed her. In her impulsive way. Matt returned the
      kiss ardently, then to his amazement, she gave one strange look into his
      eyes&mdash;blushed violently, and hung her head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come, give me another, Matt,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Matt would not comply. With one jerk she freed herself from him; then,
      swift as lightning, she ran back across the hills towards the sea.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER VII.&mdash;MATT GROWS MATRIMONIAL.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>hat night the
      young man of the caravan had curious dreams, and throughout them all
      moved, like a presiding fairy, Matt of Abertaw. Sometimes he was wandering
      on stormy shores, watching the wrecks of mighty argosies; again, he was in
      mysterious caverns underneath the ground, searching for and finding buried
      treasure; still again, he was standing on the decks of storm-tossed
      vessels, while the breakers thundered close at hand, and the bale-fires
      burned on the lonely headlands. But at all times, and in all places, Matt
      was his companion.
    </p>
    <p>
      And curiously enough, Matt in his dream was very different to the Matt of
      waking reality&mdash;taller and brighter&mdash;in fact, as beautiful as a
      vision can be; so that his spirit was full of a strange sensation of love
      and pity, and the touch of the warm little hand filled his imagination
      with mysterious joy. So vivid did this foolish dream become at last, that
      he found himself seated on a sunny rock by the sea, by Matt&rsquo;s side; and he
      was talking to her like a lover, with his arm around her waist; and she
      turned to him, with her great eyes fixed on his, and kissed him over and
      over again, so passionately&mdash;that he awoke!
    </p>
    <p>
      It was blowing hard, and the rain was pelting furiously on the roof of the
      caravan. He tried to go to sleep again, but the face of Matt (as he had
      seen it in his dream) kept him for a long time awake.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, young man,&rdquo; he said to himself, &ldquo;this is idiotic. In the first
      place, Matt is a child, not a young woman; in the second place, she is a
      vulgar little thing, not a young lady; in the third place, you ought to be
      ashamed of yourself for thinking of sentiment at all in such a connection.
      Is your brain softening, youngster? or are you labouring under the malign
      influence of William Jones? The kiss you gave to this unsophisticated
      daughter of the desert was paternal, or say, amicable; it was a very nice
      kiss, but it has no right to make you dream of stuff and nonsense.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But the influence of the dream was over him, and in that half-sleeping,
      half-waking state, he felt like a boy in love. He found himself
      calculating the age of his own friend. Let him see! it was fifteen years
      since, in her own figurative expression, she &ldquo;come ashore,&rdquo; and the
      question remained, how old was she on that interesting occasion? As far as
      he could make out from her appearance, she could not be more than sixteen.
      For a damsel of that age, her kiss was decidedly precocious.
    </p>
    <p>
      At last he tumbled off again, and dreamed that Matt was a young lady of
      beautiful attire and captivating manners to whom he was &ldquo;engaged;&rdquo; and her
      speech, strange to say, was quite poetical and refined; and they walked
      together, hand in hand, to a country church on a green hillside, and were
      just going to enter, when who should appear upon the threshold but Mr.
      Monk of Monkshurst? But they passed him by, and stood before the altar,
      where the parson stood in his white robes, and when the parson asked aloud
      whether any one saw any just cause or impediment why the pair should not
      be joined in holy matrimony, the same Monk stepped forward with
      Mephistophelian smile, and cried, &ldquo;Yes, I do!&rdquo; On which the young man
      awoke again in agitation, to find that it was broad daylight, and a fine
      fresh summer morning.
    </p>
    <p>
      Whom should he find waiting for him when he had dressed himself and
      stepped from the house on wheels but Matt herself?
    </p>
    <p>
      Yes, there she was, as wild and quaintly attired as ever, quite unlike the
      ethereal individual of his dreams; but for all that her smile was like
      sunshine, and her eyes as roguish and friendly as ever.
    </p>
    <p>
      Conscious of his dream he blushed while greeting her with a friendly nod.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, Matt? Here again, eh?&rdquo; he said; adding to himself, &ldquo;This won&rsquo;t do
      at all, my gentleman; if the young person continues to appear daily, the
      caravan will have to &lsquo;move on.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Matt had evidently something on her mind. After looking at Brinkley
      thoughtfully for some few minutes, she exclaimed abruptly&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;William Jones don&rsquo;t like you neither. No more does William Jones&rsquo;s
      father.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dear me!&rdquo; said the young man. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m very sorry for that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He says&mdash;William Jones says&mdash;you&rsquo;re come here prying and
      spying. Do you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear Matt,&rdquo; replied the young man lightly, &ldquo;I come here as a humble
      artist, seeking subjects for my surpassing genius to work upon. If it is
      prying and spying to attempt to penetrate into the beauties of nature&mdash;both
      scenic, animal, and human&mdash;I fear I must plead guilty; but otherwise&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She interrupted him with an impatient exclamation, accompanied by a hitch
      of her pretty shoulders.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t talk like that; for then I know you&rsquo;re chaffing. Talk serious, and
      I&rsquo;ll tell you something.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right. I&rsquo;ll be serious as a parson. Go ahead!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Monk of Monkshurst wants to marry me. He said so to William Jones.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The information was delivered with assumed carelessness; but after it was
      given, Matt watched the effect of it upon the hearer with precocious
      interest. Brinkley opened his eyes in very natural amazement.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come, come, Matt; you&rsquo;re joking.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I ain&rsquo;t. It&rsquo;s true.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you&rsquo;re only a child&mdash;a very nice child, I admit&mdash;but to
      talk of holy matrimony in such a connection is&mdash;excuse my frankness&mdash;preposterous.
      People don&rsquo;t marry little girls.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But Matt did not consent to this proposition at all.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I ain&rsquo;t a little girl,&rdquo; she affirmed with a decisive nod of the head.
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sixteen, and I&rsquo;m growed up.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The young man was amused, and could not refrain from laughing heartily.
      But the girl&rsquo;s brow darkened as she watched him, and her under lip fell as
      if she would like to cry.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you go on laughing,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll run straight back home, and never
      come here no more.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I&rsquo;ll try to keep my countenance; but the idea is very funny.
      Really, now? Don&rsquo;t you see it in that light yourself?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Certainly Matt did not, to judge from the expression of her face. She
      turned her head away; and Brinkley saw, to his surprise, that a tear was
      rolling down her cheek.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come, Matt,&rdquo; he said kindly; &ldquo;you mustn&rsquo;t take this so seriously. Tell me
      all about it&mdash;there&rsquo;s a good girl.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I will&mdash;if you won&rsquo;t laugh.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I won&rsquo;t then&mdash;there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, when I was lying in my bed this morning, I heard William Jones
      a-talking to some one. He thought I was asleep, but I got up and listened,
      and I heard Mr. Monk&rsquo;s voice; and he said, says he, &lsquo;She&rsquo;s over sixteen
      years old, and I&rsquo;ll marry her;&rsquo; and William Jones said, &lsquo;Lord, Mr. Monk;
      what can you be a-thinking about? Matt ain&rsquo;t old enough; and, what&rsquo;s more,
      she ain&rsquo;t fit to be the wife of a fine gentleman.&rsquo; Then Mr. Monk he
      stamped with his foot, like he does when he&rsquo;s in a passion, and he said,
      says he, &lsquo;My mind&rsquo;s made up, William Jones, and I&rsquo;m going to marry her
      before the year&rsquo;s out; and I don&rsquo;t care how soon.&rsquo; Then I heard them
      moving about, and I crept back to bed and pretended to be fast asleep.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The young man&rsquo;s astonishment increased. There could be no doubt of the
      veracity and sincerity of the speaker; and the story she told was
      certainly puzzling. Brinkley made up his mind, without much reflection,
      that if Mr. Monk wanted to go through the marriage ceremony with that
      child, he had some special and mysterious reason for so doing; unless&mdash;which
      was scarcely possible&mdash;he was of a sentimental disposition, and, in
      the manner of many men advanced towards middle age, was enamoured of
      Matt&rsquo;s youth and inexperience.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell me, Matt,&rdquo; said Brinkley, after pondering the matter for some
      minutes; &ldquo;tell me how long have you known this Mr. Monk?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ever since I come ashore,&rdquo; was the reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Humph! Is he well-to-do?&mdash;rich?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Matt nodded emphatically.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All Abertaw belongs to him,&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;and the woods up there, and the
      farms, and the horses up at the big house, and&mdash;everything.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And though he is such a great person he is very friendly with William
      Jones?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh yes,&rdquo; answered Matt; &ldquo;and I think William Jones is afraid of him&mdash;sometimes;
      but he gives William Jones money for keeping me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, indeed! He gives him money, does he? That&rsquo;s rather kind of him, you
      know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At this Matt shook her head with great decision, but said nothing. Greatly
      puzzled, the young man looked at her, and mused. It was clear that there
      was a mystery somewhere, and he was getting interested. Presently, he
      invited Matt to sit down on the steps of the caravan, and he placed
      himself at her side. He was too absorbed in speculation to notice how the
      girl coloured and brightened as they sat there together.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You have often told me that you came ashore,&rdquo; he said, after a long
      pause. &ldquo;I should like to know something of how it happened. I don&rsquo;t
      exactly know what this &lsquo;coming ashore&rsquo; means. Can you explain?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t remember,&rdquo; she replied, &ldquo;but I know there was a ship, and it went
      to pieces, and I floated to shore in a boat, or something.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I see&mdash;and William Jones found you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Monk, he found me, and gave me to William Jones to keep.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I begin to understand. Of course, you were very little&mdash;a baby, in
      fact.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;William Jones says I could just talk some words, and that when he took me
      home I called him &lsquo;Papa.&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What was the name of the ship? Have you ever heard?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Matt.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you come ashore all alone? It is scarcely possible!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I came ashore by myself. All the rest was drownded.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Was there no clue to who you were? Did nothing come ashore besides to
      show them who you were, or where you came from?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Matt shook her head again. Once more the young man was lost in meditation.
      Doubtless it was owing to his abstraction of mind that he quietly placed
      his arm round Matt&rsquo;s waist, and kept it there. At first Matt went very
      red, then she glanced up at his face, and saw that his eyes were fixed
      thoughtfully on the distant sand-hills. Seeing he still kept silence, she
      moved a little closer to him, and said very quietly&mdash;&ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t tell
      William Jones that you&mdash;kissed me!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Brinkley started from his abstraction, and looked at the girl&rsquo;s blushing
      face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Eh? What did you say?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I didn&rsquo;t tell William Jones that you kissed me!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      These words seemed to remind the young man of the position of his arm, for
      he hastily withdrew it. Then the absurdity of the whole situation appeared
      to return upon him, and he broke into a burst of boyish laughter&mdash;at
      which his companion&rsquo;s face fell once more. It was clear that she took life
      seriously, and dreaded sarcasm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Matt,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;this won&rsquo;t do! This won&rsquo;t do at all!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What won&rsquo;t do?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well&mdash;<i>this!</i>&rdquo; he answered, rather ambiguously. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re awfully
      young, you know&mdash;quite a girl, although, as you suggested just now,
      and, as you probably believe, you may be &lsquo;growed up.&rsquo; You must&mdash;ha!&mdash;you
      must look upon me as a sort of father, and all that sort of thing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;re too young to be my father,&rdquo; answered Matt, ingenuously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, say your big brother. I&rsquo;m interested in you, Matt, very much
      interested, and I should really like to get to the bottom of the mystery
      about you; but we must not forget that we&rsquo;re&mdash;well, almost strangers,
      you know. Besides,&rdquo; he added, laughing again cheerily, &ldquo;you are engaged to
      be married, some day, to a gentleman of fortune.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Matt sprang up, with heaving bosom and flashing eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I ain&rsquo;t!&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I hate <i>him!</i>&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hate the beautiful Monk of Monkshurst! Monk the beneficent! Monk the
      sweet-spoken! Impossible!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I hate him,&rdquo; cried Matt; &ldquo;and&mdash;and&mdash;when <i>he</i> kissed
      me, it made me sick.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What, did he? Actually? Kissed you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As he spoke, the young man actually felt that he should like to assault
      the redoubtable Monk.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, he kissed me&mdash;once. If he kisses me again, I&rsquo;ll stick something
      into him, or scratch his face.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And Matt looked black as thunder, and set her pearly teeth angrily
      together.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sit down again, Matt!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shan&rsquo;t&mdash;if you laugh.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I&rsquo;ll behave myself. Come!&rdquo;&mdash;and he added as she returned to her
      place, &ldquo;Did it make you sick when <i>I</i> kissed you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He was playing with fire. The girl&rsquo;s face changed in a moment, her eyes
      melted, her lips trembled, and all her expression became inexpressibly
      soft and dreamy. Leaning gently towards him, she drooped her eyes, and
      then, seeing his hand resting on his knee, she took it in hers, and raised
      it to her lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should like to marry <i>you</i>,&rdquo; she said, and blushing, rested her
      cheek against his shoulder!
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, our hero of the caravan was a truehearted young fellow, and a man of
      honour, and his position had become extremely embarrassing. He could no
      longer conceal from himself the discovery that he had made an unmistakable
      impression on Matt&rsquo;s unsophisticated heart. Hitherto he had looked upon
      her as a sort of <i>enfant terrible</i>, a very rough diamond; now he
      realized, with a shock of surprise and self-reproach, that she possessed,
      whether &ldquo;growed up&rdquo; or not, much of the susceptibility of grownup young
      ladies. It was clear that his duty was to disenchant her as speedily as
      possible, seeing that the discovery of the hopelessness of her attachment
      might, if delayed, cause her no little unhappiness.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the meantime he suffered her to nestle to him. He did not like to shake
      her off roughly, or to say anything unkind. He glanced round into her
      face; the eyes were still cast down, and the cheeks were suffused with a
      warm, rich light, which softened the great freckles and made her
      complexion look, according to the image which suggested itself to his
      mind, like a nice ripe pear. She was certainly very pretty. He glanced
      down at her hands, which rested in her lap, and again noticed that they
      were unusually delicate and small. Her foot, which he next inspected, he
      could not criticize, for the boots she wore would have been a good fit for
      William Jones. But the whole outline of her figure, in spite of the
      hideous attire she wore, was fine and symmetrical, and altogether&mdash;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      His inspection was interrupted by the girl herself. Starting as if from a
      delightful trance, she sprang to her feet and cried&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t stop no longer. I&rsquo;m going.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But the picture, Matt?&rdquo; said Brinkley, rising also. &ldquo;Shan&rsquo;t I finish it
      to-day!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t wait. William Jones wants to send me a message over to Pencroes,
      and if I don&rsquo;t go, he&rsquo;ll scold.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very well, Matt.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I&rsquo;ll come,&rdquo; she said, smiling, &ldquo;tomorrow; and I&rsquo;ll come in my Sunday
      clothes, somehow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t trouble. On reflection, I think you look nicer as you are.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She lifted her hat from the ground, and still hesitated as she put it on.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Upon my word,&rdquo; cried the artist, &ldquo;those Welsh hats are very becoming.
      Good-bye, Matt.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She took his outstretched hand and waited an instant, with her warm, brown
      cheek in profile temptingly near his lips. But he did not yield to the
      temptation, and after a moment&rsquo;s further hesitation, in which I fear she
      betrayed some little disappointment, Matt released her hand and sprang
      hurriedly away.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Upon my word,&rdquo; muttered the young man, as he watched her figure receding
      in the distance, &ldquo;the situation is growing more and more troublesome! I
      shall have to make a clean bolt of it, if this goes on. Fancy being caught
      in a flirtation with a wild ocean waif, a child of the wilderness, who
      never even heard of Lindley Murray? Really, it will never do!&rdquo;

      CHAPTER VIII.&mdash;THE DEVIL&rsquo;S CAULDRON.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">I</span>t so happened that
      the young man of the caravan had two considerable faults. The first fault
      my reader has, no doubt, already guessed&mdash;he was constitutionally
      lazy. The second fault will appear more clearly in the sequel: he was,
      also, constitutionally inquisitive. Now, his laziness was of that not
      uncommon kind which is capable of a great deal of activity, so long as
      that activity is unconscious, and not realized as being in the nature of
      <i>work</i>; and its possessor, therefore, would frequently, in his idle
      way, bestir himself a good deal; whereas, if he had been ordered to bestir
      himself, he would have yawned and resisted. Here his other constitutional
      defect came in, and set him prying into matters which in no way seriously
      concerned him. A little time before the period of his present excursion,
      when he was studying law in Dublin, and rapidly discovered that he loved
      artistic amateurship much better, he had often been known to work terribly
      hard at &ldquo;cases&rdquo; in which his curiosity was aroused; and I may add in
      passing that he had shown on these occasions an amount of shrewdness which
      would have made him an excellent lawyer, if his invincible objection to
      hard work, <i>qua</i> work, had not invariably interfered.
    </p>
    <p>
      No sooner was he left to his own meditations, which the faithful Tim (who
      had fortunately been away on a foraging expedition during the episode
      described in my last chapter) was not at hand to disturb, than our young
      gentleman began puzzling his brains over the curious information she had
      given him. The facts, which he had no reason to question, ranged
      themselves under four heads:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      1. Matt had been cast ashore, fifteen years previously, at an age when she
      could pronounce the word &ldquo;Papa.&rdquo; It followed as a rational argument that
      she had been, say, one year old, or thereabouts.
    </p>
    <p>
      2. Mr. Monk had found her, and given her into the care of William Jones,
      and had since given that worthy sums of money for taking care of her. <i>Query</i>,
      What reason had the said Monk for exhibiting so much care for the child,
      unless he were a person of wonderfully benevolent disposition, which my
      hero was not at all inclined to believe?
    </p>
    <p>
      3. Said Monk and said Jones were on very familiar terms, which was
      curious, seeing the difference in their social positions. <i>Query</i>
      again, Was there any private reason, any mysterious knowledge, any secret
      shared in common, which bound their interests together?
    </p>
    <p>
      4. Last and most extraordinary of all, said Monk had now expressed his
      wish and intention of <i>marrying</i> the waif he had rescued from the
      sea, committed to the care of said Jones, and brought up in ragged
      ignorance, innocent of grace or grammar, on that lonely shore. <i>Query</i>
      again, and again, and yet again, What the deuce had put the idea into
      Monk&rsquo;s head; and was there at the bottom of it any deeper and more
      conceivable motive than the one of ordinary affection for a pretty, if
      uncultivated, child?
    </p>
    <p>
      The more Charles Brinkley pondered all these questions, the more
      hopelessly puzzled he became. But his curiosity, once roused, could not
      rest. He determined, if possible, to get to the midriff of the mystery. So
      intent was he on this object, which fitted in beautifully with his natural
      indolence, that he at once knocked off painting for the day, and after
      breakfasting on the fare with which Tim had by this time appeared, he
      strolled away towards the sea shore.
    </p>
    <p>
      He had not gone far when he saw approaching him a tall figure which he
      seemed to recognize. It came closer, and he saw that it was Mr. Monk of
      Monkshurst.
    </p>
    <p>
      This time Monk was on foot. He wore a dark dress, with knickerbockers and
      heavy shooting boots, and carried a gun. A large dog, of the species
      lurcher, followed at his heels.
    </p>
    <p>
      Brinkley was passing by without any salutation when, to his surprise, the
      other paused and lifted his hat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I beg your pardon,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;We have met once before; and I think I have
      to-apologize to you for unintentional incivility. The fact is&mdash;h&rsquo;m&mdash;I
      mistook you for a&mdash;vagrant! I did not know you were a gentleman.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So staggered was the artist with this greeting, that he could only borrow
      the vocabulary of Mr. Toots&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, it&rsquo;s of no consequence,&rdquo; he said, attempting to pass on.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the other persevered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I assure you Mr.&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;, Mr.&mdash;&mdash;&mdash; (I have
      not the pleasure of knowing your name), that I had no desire of offending
      you; and if I did so, I beg to apologize.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Brinkley looked keenly at the speaker. His words and manner were greatly
      at variance with his looks,&mdash;even with the tone of his voice. Though
      he smiled and showed his teeth, a dark frown still disfigured his brow,
      and his mouth twitched nervously as if he were ill at ease.
    </p>
    <p>
      Regarding him thus closely, Brinkley saw that he had been somewhat
      mistaken as to his age. He was considerably under forty years of age, but
      his hair was mixed with grey, and his features strongly marked as with the
      scars of old passions. A handsome man, certainly; an amiable one,
      certainly not! Yet he had a peculiar air of power and breeding, as of one
      accustomed to command.
    </p>
    <p>
      Curiosity overcame dislike, and the young man determined to receive Mr.
      Monk&rsquo;s overture as amiably as possible.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I dare say it was a mistake,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Gentlemen don&rsquo;t usually travel
      about in caravans.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are an artist, I am informed,&rdquo; returned Monk.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Something of that sort,&rdquo; was the reply. &ldquo;I paint a little for pleasure.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And do you find this neighbourhood suit your purpose?&mdash;It is
      somewhat flat and unpicturesque.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I rather like it,&rdquo; answered Brinkley. &ldquo;It is pretty in summer; it must be
      splendid in winter, when the storms begin, and the uneventful career of
      our friend William Jones is varied by the excitement of wrecks.&rdquo; How
      Monk&rsquo;s forehead darkened! But his face smiled still as he said&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is not often that shipwrecks occur now, I am glad to say.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Brinkley, drily. &ldquo;They used to be common enough fifteen years
      ago.&rdquo; Their eyes met, and the eyes of Monk were full of fierce suspicion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why fifteen years ago, especially?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The young man shrugged his shoulders.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was told only to-day of the loss of one great ship, at that time. Matt
      told me, the little foundling. You know Matt, of course?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know whom you mean. Excuse me, but you seem to be very familiar with
      her name?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose I am,&rdquo; replied the young man. &ldquo;Matt and I are excellent
      friends.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Monk did not smile now; all his efforts to do so were ineffectual. With an
      expression of savage dislike, he looked in Brinkley&rsquo;s face, and his voice,
      though his words were still civil, trembled and grew harsh &ldquo;as scrannel
      pipes of straw.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;May I ask if you purpose remaining long in the neighbourhood?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; answered the artist. &ldquo;My time is my own, and I shall stay
      as long as the place amuses me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If I can assist in making it do so, I shall be happy, sir.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you care for rabbit shooting? If so, there is some sport to be had
      among the sand-hills.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I never shoot anything,&rdquo; was the reply, &ldquo;except, I suppose, &lsquo;folly as it
      flies;&rsquo; though with what species of firearm that interesting sport is
      pursued,&rdquo; he added, as if to himself, &ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t the slightest idea!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, good day,&rdquo; said Monk, with an uneasy scowl. &ldquo;If I can be of any
      service to you, command me!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And, raising his hat again, he stalked away.
    </p>
    <p>

    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, what in the name of all that is wonderful, does Mr. Monk of
      Monkshurst mean by becoming so civil?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This was the question the young man asked himself, as he strolled away
      seaward. He could not persuade himself that he had wronged Monk, that that
      gentleman was in reality an amiable person, instead of a domineering
      bully; no, that suggestion was contradicted by every expression of the
      man&rsquo;s baleful and suspicious face. What, then, could be the explanation of
      his sudden access of courtesy?
    </p>
    <p>
      An idea! an inspiration! As it flashed into his mind, the young man gave
      vent to a prolonged whistle. Possibly, Monk was&mdash;jealous!
    </p>
    <p>
      The idea was a preposterous one, and almost amusing. It was not to be
      conceived, on the first blush of it, that jealousy would make a surly man
      civil, a savage man gentle; it would rather have the contrary effect,
      unless&mdash;here Brinkley grew thoughtful&mdash;unless his gloomy rival
      had some sinister design which he wished to cloak with politeness?
    </p>
    <p>
      But jealous of little Matt! Brinkley laughed heartily, when he fully
      realized the absurdity of the notion.
    </p>
    <p>
      He crossed the sand-hills, and came again to the path which he and Matt
      had followed the previous day. A smart breeze was coming in from the
      sou&rsquo;-west, and the air was fresh and cool though sunny; but clouds were
      gathering to windward, and the weather was evidently broken. Reaching the
      cliffs, he descended them, and came down on the rocks beneath. A long
      jagged point ran out from the spot where he stood, and the water to
      leeward of the same was quite calm, though rising and falling in strong
      troubled swells. So bright and tempting did it look in that sheltered
      place, that he determined to have a swim.
    </p>
    <p>
      He stripped leisurely, and, placing his clothes in a safe place, took a
      header off the rocks. It was clear at once that he was a powerful swimmer.
      Breasting the smooth swell, he struck out from shore, and when he had gone
      about a hundred yards, floated lazily on his back and surveyed the shore.
    </p>
    <p>
      The cliffs were not very high, but their forms were finely picturesque.
      Here and there were still green creeks, fringed with purple weed; and
      large shadowy caves, hewn roughly in the side of the crags; and rocky
      islets, covered with slimy weed and awash with the lapping water. A little
      to the right of the spot from which he had dived, the cliff seemed
      hollowed out, forming a wide passage which the sea entered with a tramp
      and a rush and a roar.
    </p>
    <p>
      Towards this passage Brinkley swam. He knew the danger of such places, for
      he had often explored them both in Cornwall and the West of Ireland; but
      he had confidence in his own natatory skill. Approaching the shore
      leisurely with strong, slow strokes, he paused outside the passage, and
      observed that the sea swell, entering the opening, rushed and quickened
      itself like a rapid shooting to the fall, turning at the base of the cliff
      into a cloud of thin prismatic spray. Suddenly, through the top of the
      spray, a cloud of rock pigeons emerged, winging their flight rapidly along
      the crags.
    </p>
    <p>
      Brinkley knew by the last phenomenon that the spray concealed the entrance
      of some large subterranean cavern. If any doubt had remained on his mind,
      it would have been dispelled by the appearance of a solitary pigeon, which
      leaving its companions, wavered lightly back, flew back through the spray
      with a rapid downward flight, and disappeared.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was floating a little nearer, with an enjoyment deepened by the sense
      of danger, when a figure suddenly appeared on the rocks close by him,
      wildly waving its hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Keep back! Keep back!&rdquo; cried a voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      He looked at the figure, and recognized William Jones. He answered him,
      but the sound of his voice was drowned by the roar from the rocks. Then
      William Jones shouted again more indistinctly, and repeated his excited
      gestures. It was clear that he was warning the swimmer against some hidden
      danger. Brinkley took the warning, and struck out from the shore, and then
      back to the place where he had left his clothes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Watching his opportunity, he found a suitable spot and clambered in upon
      the rocks. He had just dried himself and thrown on some of his clothes,
      when he saw William Jones standing near and watching him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How are you?&rdquo; asked the young man, with a nod. &ldquo;Pray, what did you mean
      by going on in that absurd way just now?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What did I mean?&rdquo; repeated William, with a little of his former
      excitement. &ldquo;Look ye, now, I was waving you back from the Devil&rsquo;s
      Cauldron. There&rsquo;s many a man been drowned there, and been washed away Lord
      knows where. I&rsquo;ve heerd tell,&rdquo; he added solemnly, &ldquo;they&rsquo;re carried right
      down into the Devil&rsquo;s own kitchen.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m much obliged to you, Mr. Jones, but I&rsquo;m used to such places, and I
      think I know how to take care of myself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      William Jones shook his head a little angrily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you come here no more, that&rsquo;s all!&rdquo; he said, and muttering
      ominously to himself, retired. But he only ascended the neighbouring crag,
      and squatting himself there like a bird of ill-omen, kept his eyes on the
      stranger.
    </p>
    <p>
      Having dressed himself, Brinkley climbed in the same direction. He found
      William seated on the edge of the crag, looking the reverse of amiable,
      and amusing himself by throwing stones in the direction of the sea.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You seem to know this place well?&rdquo; said the young man, standing over him.
    </p>
    <p>
      William Jones replied, without looking up.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I ought to; I were born here. Father were born here. Know it? I wish I
      know&rsquo;d as well how to make my own fortin&rsquo;.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And yet they tell me,&rdquo; observed the other, watching him slily, &ldquo;that
      William Jones of Abertaw has money in the bank, and is a rich man!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He saw William&rsquo;s colour change at once, but recovering himself at once,
      the worthy gave a contemptuous grunt, and aimed a stone spitefully at a
      large gull which just then floated slowly by.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who told you <i>that?</i>&rdquo; he asked, glancing quickly up, and then
      looking down again. &ldquo;Some tomfool, wi&rsquo; no more sense in un than that gull.
      Rich? I wish I was, I do!&rdquo; Brinkley was amused, and a little curious.
      Laughing gaily, he threw himself down by William&rsquo;s side. William shifted
      his seat uneasily, and threw another stone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear Mr. Jones,&rdquo; said the young man, assuming the flippant style which
      Matt found so irritating, &ldquo;I have often wondered how you get your living.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      William started nervously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are, I believe, a fisherman by profession; yet you never go fishing.
      You possess a boat, but you are seldom seen to use it. You are not, I
      think, of a poetical disposition; yet you spend your days in watching the
      water, like a poet, or a person in love. I conclude, very reluctantly,
      that your old habits stick to you, and that you speculate on the disasters
      of your fellow creatures.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What d&rsquo;ye mean, master?&rdquo; grunted William, puzzled and a little alarmed by
      this style of address.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A nice wreck, now, would admirably suit your tastes? A well-laden
      Indiaman, smashing up on the reef-yonder, would lend sunshine to your
      existence, and deepen your faith in a paternal Providence? Eh, Mr. Jones?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know nowt about no wrecks,&rdquo; was the reply. &ldquo;They&rsquo;re no consarn o&rsquo;
      mine.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, but I have heard you lament the good old times, when wrecking was a
      respectable occupation, and when there were no impertinent coastguards to
      interfere with respectable followers of the business. By the way, I have
      often wondered, Mr. Jones, if popular report is true, and if, among these
      cliffs or the surrounding sand-hills, there is buried treasure, cast up
      from time to time by the sea, and concealed by energetic persons like
      yourself?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      William Jones could stand this no longer. Looking as pale as it was
      possible for so rubicund a person to become, and glancing round him
      suspiciously, he rose to his feet, &ldquo;I know nowt o&rsquo; that,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;If
      there <i>is</i> summat, I wish I could find it; but sech things never come
      the way of honest chaps like me. Good mornin&rsquo;, master! Take a poor man&rsquo;s
      advice, and don&rsquo;t you go swimming no more near the Devil&rsquo;s Cauldron!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So saying, he walked off in the direction of the deserted village.
      Presently Brinkley rose and followed him, keeping him steadily in view.
      From time to time William Jones looked round, as if to see whether the
      other was coming; lingering when Brinkley lingered, hastening his pace
      when Brinkley hastened his. As an experiment, Brinkley turned and began
      walking back towards the cliffs. Glancing round over his shoulder, he saw
      William Jones had also turned, and was walking back.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Curious!&rdquo; he reflected. &ldquo;The innocent one is keeping me in view. I have a
      good mind to breathe him!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He struck off from the path, and hastened, running rather than walking,
      towards the sand-hills. So soon as he was certain that he was followed, he
      began to run in good earnest. To his delight, William began running too.
      He plunged among the sandhills, and was soon engaged busily running up and
      down them, hither and thither. From time to time he caught a glimpse of
      his pursuer. It was an exciting chase. When he had been engaged in it for
      half an hour, and was almost breathless himself, he suddenly paused in one
      of the deep hollows, threw himself down on his back, and lit a cigar. A
      few minutes afterwards, he heard a sound as of violent puffing and
      breathing, and the next instant William Jones, panting, gasping,
      perspiring at every pore, appeared above him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How d&rsquo;ye do, Mr. Jones?&rdquo; he cried gaily. &ldquo;Come and have a cigar!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Instead of replying, William Jones looked completely thunderstruck, and
      after glaring feebly down and muttering incoherently, disappeared as
      suddenly as he had come.
    </p>
    <p>
      Brinkley finished his cigar leisurely, and then strolled back to the
      caravan.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER IX.&mdash;THE SECRET OF THE CAVE.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>he young man of
      the caravan was now thoroughly convinced that one of two things must be
      true, either that William Jones had been instructed to keep a watch upon
      him, or that he, William Jones, had a secret of some sort which he was
      anxious not to have revealed. After both suppositions had been duly
      weighed, the second was accepted as the most likely; and it forthwith
      received the young man&rsquo;s consideration.
    </p>
    <p>
      If there was a secret, he argued, it was in some way connected, firstly,
      with William Jones&rsquo;s worldly prosperity; secondly, with the reports
      current of treasure hidden in times past among the sand-hills or the
      dangerous caverns of the sea. Was it possible, after all, that those
      reports were true, and that in some mysterious manner Jones had become
      acquainted with the hiding-place? It seemed very improbable for many
      reasons, one of the chief being the man&rsquo;s extreme poverty, which appeared
      to touch the very edge of sheer starvation.
    </p>
    <p>
      A little inquiry in the neighbourhood, however, elicited the information
      that Jones, despite his abject penury, was certainly well-to-do, and had
      money in the bank of the neighbouring market town; that the ruined village
      of Abertaw belonged almost entirely to him; and that, in short, he was by
      nature and habit a miserly person, who would prefer hoarding up whatever
      he possessed to purchasing with it the commonest necessaries of life.
    </p>
    <p>
      An old coastguard, whom Brinkley found next day on the station, was his
      chief informant.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you believe him, sir,&rdquo; said this old salt, &ldquo;if he tells you he&rsquo;s
      poor. He&rsquo;s a shark, William Jones is, and couldn&rsquo;t own up even to his own
      father. It&rsquo;s my belief he&rsquo;s got gold hidden somewheres among them
      sandhills, let alone what he&rsquo;s got in the savings bank. Ah, he&rsquo;s a artful
      one, is William Jones.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Brinkley had said nothing of his own private suspicions, but had merely
      introduced in a general way the subject of Jones&rsquo;s worldly position.
      Further conversation with Tim, who had made a few straggling acquaintances
      in the district, corroborated the other testimony. The young man became
      more and more convinced that William Jones was worth studying.
    </p>
    <p>
      Matt had not turned up that morning. Instead of looking after her,
      Brinkley took another stroll towards the vicinity of the Devil&rsquo;s Cauldron.
      He had not gone far before he discovered that he was watched again. The
      figure of William Jones followed in the distance, but keeping him well in
      view.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was certainly curious.
    </p>
    <p>
      He walked over to the cliffs and looked down at the scene of yesterday&rsquo;s
      bathing adventure. A strong wind was blowing, and the waves were surging
      up the rocks with deafening roar and foamy spume. The place looked very
      ugly, particularly near the Cauldron. All the passage was churned to milky
      white, and the sound from beneath was, to quote an old simile, like the
      roar of innumerable chariots.
    </p>
    <p>
      He glanced over his shoulder, and saw the head of William Jones eagerly
      watching, the body being hidden behind an intervening rock.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Strange!&rdquo; he reflected. &ldquo;My predatory friend can&rsquo;t keep his treasure, if
      he possesses any, down in that watery gulf. Yet whenever I come near it
      his manner tells me that I am &lsquo;warm,&rsquo; as they say in the game of hide and
      seek.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      To test the matter a little further he set off on a brisk walk along the
      cliffs, leaving the Cauldron behind. He found, as he had suspected, that
      he was no longer followed. Returning as he came, and resuming his old
      position, he saw William Jones immediately re-appear.
    </p>
    <p>
      That day he discovered no clue to the mystery, nor the next, nor the next
      again, though on each day he went through a similar performance. Strange
      to say, Matt had not put in an appearance, and for reasons of his own he
      had thought it better not to seek her.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the morning of the third day&mdash;a dark chilly morning after a night
      of rain&mdash;Tim put his head into the caravan, where his master was
      seated at his easel, and grinned delightedly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Charles! She&rsquo;s come, sor!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who the deuce has come?&rdquo; cried Brinkley.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The <i>lady</i>, your honour, to have her picture taken. Will I show her
      into the parlour?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But as he spoke Matt pushed him aside and entered. She wore her best
      clothes, but looked a little pale and anxious, Brinkley thought, as he
      greeted her with a familiar nod.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So you&rsquo;ve come at last? Tim, get out, you rascal. I thought you had given
      me up.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He assumed a coldness, though he felt it not, for he had made up his mind
      not to &ldquo;encourage&rdquo; the young person.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t come before&mdash;they wouldn&rsquo;t let me. But last night William
      Jones he didn&rsquo;t come home, and I broke open the box and took out my
      clothes, and ran straight off here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Her face fell as she proceeded, for she could not fail to notice the
      coolness of the young man&rsquo;s greeting.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, since you <i>have</i> come, we&rsquo;ll get to work,&rdquo; said Brinkley.
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s chilly and damp outside, so we&rsquo;ll remain here in shelter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Matt took off her hat, and then proceeded to divest herself of her coarse
      jacket, revealing for the first time the low-necked silk dress beneath.
      Meantime the young man placed the sketch in position. Turning presently,
      he beheld Matt&rsquo;s transformation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Old and shabby as the dress was, torn here and there, and revealing
      beneath glimpses of coarse stockings and clumsy boots, it became her
      wonderfully. As a result of much polishing with soap and water her face
      shone again, and her arms and neck were white as snow. Thus attired, Matt
      looked no longer a long shambling girl, but a tall, bright, resplendent,
      young lady.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was no use. Brinkley could not conceal his admiration. Matt&rsquo;s arm alone
      was enough to make a painter wild with delight.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, Matt, you look positively magnificent. I had no idea you were so
      pretty.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The girl blushed with pleasure.
    </p>
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <p>
      The young man worked away for a good hour and a half, at the end of which
      time he put the finishing touch to the sketch.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Finis coronat opus!</i>&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;Look, Matt!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Matt examined the picture with unconcealed delight. It was herself, a
      little idealized, but quite characteristic, and altogether charming.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;May I take it home?&rdquo; she asked eagerly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll get you to leave it a few days longer. I must get a frame for it,
      Matt, and then you shall have it all complete. Now, let me look at you
      again,&rdquo; he said, taking her by both hands and looking up at her sunny
      face. &ldquo;Are you pleased? Will you take care of the picture for the
      painter&rsquo;s sake?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Matt&rsquo;s answer was embarrassing. She quietly sat down on his knee, and gave
      him a smacking kiss.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Matt! Matt!&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;You mustn&rsquo;t!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But she put her warm arm round his neck, and rested her cheek against his
      shoulder.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should like to have pretty dresses and gold bracelets and things, and
      to go away from William Jones and to stay with <i>you</i>.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My dear,&rdquo; said Brinkley, laughing, &ldquo;you couldn&rsquo;t. It wouldn&rsquo;t be proper.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why not?&rdquo; asked Matt simply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The world is censorious little one. I am a young man, you are a young
      lady. We shall have to shake hands soon and say good-bye. There, there,&rdquo;
       he continued, seeing her eyes fill with tears, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not gone yet. I shall
      stay as long as I can, only&mdash;really&mdash;you must look upon me as
      quite an old fellow. I <i>am</i> awfully old, you know, compared to you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He gently disengaged himself, and Matt sat down on a camp stool close by.
      Her face had grown very wistful and sad, &ldquo;Matt,&rdquo; he said, anxious to
      change the subject, &ldquo;tell me something more about William Jones.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hate William Jones. I hate everybody&mdash;but <i>you</i>.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Really?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I feel greatly flattered. But about the gentle Jones? You say he
      was out all last night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Matt nodded.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He goes out nigh every night,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;and often don&rsquo;t come home till
      morning, Sometimes he finds things and brings &rsquo;em. He finds bits o&rsquo;
      gold and old ropes and bottles o&rsquo; rum.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very odd. Where?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He don&rsquo;t tell; <i>I</i> know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wish you&rsquo;d tell me, Matt. Do, I have a particular reason for wanting
      the information.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You won&rsquo;t say I told? William Jones would be downright wild, he would.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll keep the secret faithfully. Now.&rdquo; Thus urged, Matt informed her
      friend that on two occasions, out of curiosity, she had followed her
      guardian on his nightly pilgrimages, and watched him go in the direction
      of the Devil&rsquo;s Cauldron. On both occasions the night was very dark. On
      getting clear of the coastguard station, and among the sand-hills, Jones
      had lighted a lantern which he carried. Trembling and afraid, she had
      followed the light along the cliffs, then out among the sand-hills. But
      all at once the light and its bearer had disappeared into the solid earth,
      leaving her to find her way home in terror.
    </p>
    <p>
      The explanation of all this was, in Matt&rsquo;s opinion, very simple. William
      Jones was a bad man, and went to &ldquo;visit the fairies.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she cried, &ldquo;and every time he goes the fairies give him summat, and
      he brings it home.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Each time you followed him,&rdquo; asked Brinkley, thoughtfully, &ldquo;he
      disappeared at about the same place?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Matt, &ldquo;and the light and him sunk right down and never come up
      again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <p>
      The result of the information thus communicated was to leave the young man
      of the caravan far more curious than ever. He determined to turn the
      tables on William Jones, and to watch his movements, not in the daytime,
      but during the summer night, waiting for his appearance in the immediate
      neighbourhood of the Devil&rsquo;s Cauldron.
    </p>
    <p>
      The first night he saw nothing&mdash;it was stormy, with wild gusts of
      rain. The second night was equally uneventful. Nothing daunted, he went
      for a third and last time, and lay in the moonlight on the cliffs, looking
      towards the village.
    </p>
    <p>
      The night was dark and cloudy, but from time to time the moon came out
      with sudden brilliance on the sea, which was gently stirred by a breeze
      from the land.
    </p>
    <p>
      He waited for several hours. About midnight he rose to go home. As he did
      so he was startled by the sound of oars, and lying down perceived a small
      boat approaching on a silver patch of moonlit sea.
    </p>
    <p>
      The moon came out, and he saw that the occupant of the boat was a solitary
      man.
    </p>
    <p>
      It approached rapidly, making direct for the Devil&rsquo;s Cauldron. Lying down
      on his face and peeping over, Brinkley saw it stop short just outside the
      foaming passage, while the man stood up, stooped, lifted something heavy
      from the bottom, and threw it overboard. Then, after watching for a moment
      a dark object which drifted shoreward, right into the Cauldron, he rowed
      away until he reached a sheltered creek close to the scene of the swimming
      adventure. Here he ran the boat ashore and leapt out.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next minute Brinkley heard him coming up the cliffs, trembling with
      excitement he lay down flat on his face and waited. Presently the man
      emerged on the top of the cliffs, within a few yards of Brinkley&rsquo;s
      hiding-place. Just then the moon flashed brightly out, and Brinkley
      recognized him.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was William Jones, carrying on his shoulders something like a loaded
      sack, and dangling from his left wrist, a horn lantern.
    </p>
    <p>
      He looked round once or twice and then hurried towards the sand-hills.
      Brinkley followed stealthily. The moon now went in, and it became pitch
      dark. Presently Jones paused, set down his load, and lit the lantern; then
      he hurried on.
    </p>
    <p>
      For fifty or sixty yards a coarse carpet of green sward covered the
      cliffs; then the sandhills began. Passing over the first sand-hill, Jones
      disappeared. Quick as thought the young man followed, and, peering over,
      saw the light in the hollow beneath; it rose higher and higher till it
      reached the top of the next sand-hill, where it paused. Crawling on hands
      and knees Brinkley slipped down into the hollow, and then crept upward;
      halfway up the mound he found a huge rock, behind which he crouched and
      peeped.
    </p>
    <p>
      As he did so, William Jones, light in hand, seemed to dive down into the
      solid earth and disappear.
    </p>
    <p>
      For a minute after the disappearance, Charles Brinkley lay as if
      petrified; and, indeed, he was altogether lost in wonder. What had
      happened? Had an earthquake swallowed the mysterious one, or had he
      tumbled down in a fit? Brinkley waited and watched, five minutes had
      passed, ten minutes, and still the light did not re-emerge. At last,
      overcome by his curiosity, Brinkley rose, and, stooping close to the
      ground, crept from the rock behind which he had lain concealed, and
      crawled across the summit of the sand-hill. Suddenly he stopped short, and
      went down on hands and knees, for he now clearly discerned, coming out of
      the solid earth or sand, the glimmer of the light.
    </p>
    <p>
      It glimmered, then disappeared again. Just then the moon came out of her
      cloud, illuminating the hillocks with vitreous rays; and he perceived
      close by him a dark hole opening into the very heart of the hillock.
    </p>
    <p>
      He crept closer and looked down, but could see nothing. He held his head
      over the hole and listened; all he heard was a dull, hollow moaning, like
      the sound of the sea. The light of the moon, however, enabled him to
      perceive that the hole had been covered with a loose piece of wood, or
      lid, about four feet square, and with an iron ringbolt in the centre,
      which lid was now lying by the side of the opening, ready to be replaced.
      A number of large pieces of stone, such as were strewn everywhere about
      the sand-hills, lay piled close by.
    </p>
    <p>
      He lay for some time waiting and listening. All at once, far behind him,
      the light glimmered again. Quick as thought he rose and crept away, only
      just in time; for he had no sooner regained the shelter of the rock, and
      crouched there watching, than he saw the light re-emerge, accompanied by a
      human head; a human body followed, and then he clearly discerned William
      Jones-standing in the moonlight without the burthen he had previously
      carried, and holding in his hand a lantern.
    </p>
    <p>
      Setting the lantern down, William busied himself for several minutes, and
      finally, having concluded the work on which he was engaged, extinguished
      the light. Then, after glancing suspiciously round him on every side, he
      walked rapidly down the sand-hill, and disappeared in the direction of the
      sea.
    </p>
    <p>
      Not until he distinctly heard the splash of oars, and saw the black
      silhouette of the boat pass out from the shadow of the rock on to the
      moonlit sea, did Brinkley again begin to stir; and even then he did so
      very cautiously, lest his figure should be perceived against the moonlight
      by the lynx-eyed rower.
    </p>
    <p>
      Creeping on hands and knees, he again crawled to the mysterious spot, and
      found, as he had indeed anticipated, that the hole was covered up, and the
      wooden lid or trapdoor so carefully covered with stones and loose sand as
      to be completely hidden.
    </p>
    <p>
      His first impulse was to displace the <i>debris</i>, and at once to
      explore the mysterious place; but reflecting that he was unprovided with
      lights of any kind, and that the cavity below would most certainly be in
      total darkness, he determined to postpone his visit of inspection until
      daylight. By this time there was no sight or sound of the boat. Rising to
      his feet, he mused. It was all very well to talk of returning another
      time, but how was he to find the spot? The sea of sandy hillocks stretched
      on every side, and he knew by experience how difficult it was to
      distinguish one hillock from another. As to the cairns of loose stones,
      such cairns were nearly as numerous as the hillocks themselves.
    </p>
    <p>
      At last he thought of the rock where he had first concealed himself. Such
      rocks were numerous, too; but pulling out his ease of crayons, he marked
      the base of the rock with a small streak of colour. Finally, remembering
      that the drift sand might cover this mark so made, he drew out his
      penknife, and made a large cross in the hard sand. Having taken these
      precautions, he made the best of his way down to the cliffs, and following
      the open green sward which fringed the crags, made the best of his way
      home to the caravan.
    </p>
    <p>
      At daybreak the next day he strolled back along the crags, first taking a
      bird&rsquo;s-eye view of the village; and perceiving no sight of William Jones,
      who had doubtless no suspicion that he would rise so early, he soon found
      the spot where he had stood overnight, watching the approach of the boat;
      and first reconnoitring the neighbourhood, struck off among the
      sand-hills. At first he was guided by footprints, but as the sand grew
      harder, these disappeared. At length, after a somewhat bewildering search,
      he found the sandhill he sought, the rock with his mark upon it, the cross
      marked in the ground, and finally, the well-concealed mouth of the hole.
    </p>
    <p>
      He looked keenly to right and left. No one was visible. Stooping down he
      displaced the stones and loose sand, and disclosed the trap-door with its
      iron ring. A long pull, a strong pull, and up came the trap. Open Sesame!
      Behind him was a dark cavity, with a slanting path descending into the
      bowels of the earth.
    </p>
    <p>
      Anxious to lose no time, he squeezed himself through the aperture, and
      began descending. While he did so he heard the hollow roaring he had heard
      the night before. As he proceeded he drew out a box of matches and a
      candle, which he lit. Proceeding cautiously on his back, and restraining
      himself with his elbows from too rapid descent, he found himself
      surrounded not by sand, but by solid rock, and peering downward, saw that
      he was looking down into a large subterranean cave.
    </p>
    <p>
      Just beneath him was a flight of steps cut in the solid. Descending these
      carefully, for they were slippery as ice, he reached the bottom, and found
      it formed of sea-gravel and loose shells, forming indeed a decline like
      the sea-shore itself, to the edge of which, filling about half the cavern,
      the waters of the sea crept with a long monotonous moan. Approaching the
      water&rsquo;s edge he saw facing him the solid walls of the cliff, but just at
      the base there was an opening, a sort of slit, almost touching the waves
      at all times, quite touching them when the swell rose, and through this
      opening crept beams of daylight, turning the waves to a clear malachite
      green.
    </p>
    <p>
      The mystery was now clear enough. The cave communicated directly with the
      sea, but in such a way as to make an entrance for any large object
      impossible from that direction.
    </p>
    <p>
      Turning his back upon the water, and holding up the candle, he examined
      the interior. The damp black rocks rose on every side, and from the roof
      hung spongy weeds and funguses like those which are to be seen in sunless
      vaults of wine, but piled against the inner wall was a hoard of treasures
      enough to make a smuggler&rsquo;s mouth water or turn a wrecker&rsquo;s brain.
    </p>
    <p>
      Puncheons of rum and other spirits, bales of wool, planks of mahogany and
      pine, oars, broken masts, coils of rope, tangles of running rigging, flags
      of all nations, and other articles such as are used on ship-board;
      swinging tables, brass swinging lamps, masthead lanterns, and hammocks;
      enough and to spare, in short, to fit out a small fleet of vessels. Lost
      in amazement, Brinkley examined this extraordinary hoard, the accumulation
      doubtless of many years. All at once his eye fell upon a large canvas bag,
      rotten with age, and gaping open. It was as full as it could hold with
      pieces of gold, bearing the superscription of the mint of Spain.
    </p>
    <p>
      Oh, William Jones! William Jones! And all this was yours, at least by
      right of plunder, upon the Queen&rsquo;s sea-way; all this which, turned into
      cash, would have made a man rich beyond the dreams of avarice, was the
      possession of one who lived like a miserly beggar, grudged himself and his
      flesh and blood the common necessaries of life, and had never been known,
      from boyhood upward, to give a starving fellow-creature so much as a crust
      of bread, or to drop a penny into the poor-box. Oh, William Jones! William
      Jones!
    </p>
    <p>
      The above reflections belong, not to the present writer, but to my
      adventurous discoverer, the captain of the caravan.
    </p>
    <p>
      As Brinkley proceeded on his tour of inspection, he became more and more
      struck with wonder. Nothing seemed too insignificant or too preposterously
      useless for secretion in that extraordinary ship&rsquo;s cavern. There were mops
      and brooms, there were holy-stones, there were &ldquo;squeegees,&rdquo; there were
      canisters of tinned provisions, there were bags of adamantine
      ship-biscuits, there were sacks of potatoes (which esculents, long
      neglected, had actually sprouted, and put forth leaves), there were
      ringbolts, there were tin mugs, and, lastly, <i>mirabile dictu</i>, there
      were books&mdash;said books lay piled on the top of a heap of sacks, and
      were in the last stage of mildew and decay. For what purpose had they been
      carried there? Certainly not to form a library, for William Jones could
      not read. As curiosity deepened, Brinkley opened some of the forlorn
      volumes, covered with mildew, and full of hideous crawling things. Most
      were in foreign tongues, but there were several English novels half a
      century old, and a book of famous &ldquo;Voyages,&rdquo; also in English. Near to them
      were several large paper rolls&mdash;ship&rsquo;s charts, evidently, and almost
      falling to pieces. And on the top of the charts was a tiny Prayer-book,
      slime-covered, and dripping wet!
    </p>
    <p>
      What possessed Brinkley to examine the Prayer-book I cannot determine, but
      in after years he always averred that it was an inspiration. At any rate,
      he did open it, and saw that the fly-leaf was covered with writing,
      yellow, difficult to decipher, fast fading away. But what more
      particularly attracted his attention was a loose piece of parchment,
      fastened to the title-page with a rusty pin, and covered also with written
      characters.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fixing the candle on a nook in the damp wall, he inspected the title-page,
      and deciphered these words:&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Christmas Eve, 1864, on board the ship <i>Trinidad,</i> fast breaking up
      on the Welsh coast. If any Christian soul should find this book and these
      lines where I place them, if they sink not with their bearer (on whom I
      leave my last despairing blessing) to the bottom of the sea, or if God in
      His infinite mercy should spare and save the little child&rdquo; (the book
      trembled in his hand, as he read. The writing went on): &ldquo;I cast her adrift
      in her cradle in sight of shore, on a little raft made by my own hands. &rsquo;Tis
      a desperate hope, but He can work miracles, and if it is His will, she may
      be saved. Attached to this holy book are the proofs of her poor dead
      mother&rsquo;s marriage and my darling&rsquo;s birth. May she live to inherit my name.
      Signed, Matthew Thorpe Monk, Colonel, 15th Cavalry, Bengal.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The mystery was deepening indeed! At last Brinkley thrust the book and its
      contents into his pocket, and, after one look round, took the candle, and
      made his way up the rocks, and out of the cave. When he saw the light of
      day above him, he blew out the light, and crawled up through the aperture.
      Then, standing on the lonely sand-hill, he surveyed the scene on every
      side. There was no sign of any living soul. Carefully, but rapidly, he
      returned the trap-door to its place, covered it with the stones and
      liberal handfuls of loose sand, and walked away, taking care, for the
      first hundred yards, to obliterate his footprints as he went.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER X.&mdash;MYSTERIOUS BEHAVIOUR OF THE YOUNG GENTLEMAN.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">A</span>bout this time
      Matt noticed a curious change come over her artist friend. He was more
      thoughtful, and consequently less entertaining. Often when she appeared
      and began chatting to him about affairs in which she thought he might take
      some interest, she had the mortification not merely of eliciting no reply,
      but of finding that he had not heard a word of her conversation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now this style of proceeding would certainly have caused her some
      annoyance, but for one compensating fact, which put the balance entirely
      on the other side. It was evident that, despite the change, Brinkley&rsquo;s
      interest in Matt was not lessening, nay, it rather seemed to be on the
      increase, and this fact Matt, very woman as she was, was quick to
      perceive.
    </p>
    <p>
      Very often, on looking suddenly at him, she found his eyes fixed
      wonderingly and sympathetically upon her. She asked him on one occasion
      what he was thinking about.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>You</i>, Matt,&rdquo; he answered promptly. &ldquo;I was trying to imagine,&rdquo; he
      continued, seeing her blush and hang her head, &ldquo;how you would look in
      silks and velvets; got up, in fact, like a grand demoiselle. What would
      you say, now, if a good fairy were to find you out some day, and were to
      offer to change you from what you are to a fine young lady&mdash;would you
      say Yes?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Matt reflected for a moment, then she followed her feminine instinct, and
      nodded her head vigorously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah!&mdash;by the way, Matt, can you <i>read?</i>&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Print, not writing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And write?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just a bit.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who taught you? William Jones?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, that he didn&rsquo;t. I learned off Tim Pensera down village. William
      Jones, he can&rsquo;t read and he can&rsquo;t write; no more can William Jones&rsquo;s
      father.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This last piece of information set the young man thinking so deeply that
      the rest of the interview became rather dull for Matt. When she rose to
      go, however, he came out of his abstraction, and asked her if she would
      return on the following day.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know&mdash;p&rsquo;raps!&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; returned the young man, assuming his flippant manner, &ldquo;you find me
      tedious company, I fear. The fact is, I am generally affected in this
      manner in the present state of the moon. But come to-morrow, Matt. Your
      presence does me good.&rdquo; However, the next day passed, and the next again,
      and there was no sign of Matt. He began to think that the child had taken
      offence, and that he would have to seek her in her own home, when her
      opportune appearance prevented the journey. He was taking his breakfast
      one morning inside the caravan, when he suddenly became conscious that
      Matt was standing outside watching him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, you are there, are you?&rdquo; he said coolly. &ldquo;Come in and have some
      breakfast, Matt.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He rose negligently, went to the door, and held forth his hand; Matt took
      it, gave one spring, and landed inside the vehicle.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tim, another knife and fork for the young lady&mdash;some more eggs and
      milk; in fact, anything you&rsquo;ve got!&rdquo; said Brinkley, as he placed a seat
      for Matt at the little table.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tim gave a grunt of dissatisfaction. This &ldquo;bold colleen,&rdquo; as he called
      her, was becoming too much for him; but he perforce obeyed his master&rsquo;s
      commands. Matt sat down and ate with an appetite; Brinkley played
      negligently with his knife, and watched her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is two days since you were here, Matt,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;I was seriously
      thinking of coming to look for you. Why wouldn&rsquo;t you come before?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&rsquo;Twasn&rsquo;t that!&rdquo; said Matt. &ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Couldn&rsquo;t? Why?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, <i>he</i> wouldn&rsquo;t let me, William Jones. He says he&rsquo;ll smash me if
      I come here and talk to you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As Matt spoke, her bosom heaved and her eyes flashed fire.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He ain&rsquo;t at home to-day,&rdquo; she said, in answer to the young man&rsquo;s query
      concerning the ex-wrecker; &ldquo;he&rsquo;s gone up to market town, and won&rsquo;t be back
      before night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As Brinkley looked at her, a sudden thought seemed to strike him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Matt,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;you and I will go wreck-hunting this afternoon; that is,
      if you&rsquo;ve no objection.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She certainly had none: wherever he went she seemed willing to follow. In
      a very little while the two had started off. It was Brinkley who led this
      time, Matt walking along beside him like a confiding child.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By the way, Matt,&rdquo; he said presently, &ldquo;you told me once of treasures
      being hidden amongst the sand-hills. Did anybody ever find any?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not that I know on.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;William Jones, for instance?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No. Leastways, <i>I</i> don&rsquo;t know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, what would you say, Matt, if I told you that <i>I</i> had found
      one?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>If you?</i>&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes. I wonder if you can keep a secret? Yes, on reflection I think you
      can. Now, before we go any further, Matt, first you place your hand in
      mine, and promise never to mention until I give you permission what I am
      about to confide in you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Matt&rsquo;s curiosity was aroused.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right,&rdquo; she replied eagerly, &ldquo;<i>I</i> shan&rsquo;t tell.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Very good,&rdquo; replied Brinkley. &ldquo;We will now proceed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They passed on amongst the sand-hills, and came to the entrance of the
      cave. Brinkley removed the stones and sand from the hole, and entered.
      Breathless with curiosity, Matt followed. They reached the bottom.
      Brinkley struck a light, and pointed out to her all the wonderful
      treasures which the cave contained. It was such a surprise to the girl
      that for a time she could do nothing but stare and stare in speechless
      wonder. Whistling gaily, Brinkley turned about the casks of rum and
      brandy, and thrust his hands into the bags, and let the gleaming gold slip
      through his fingers.
    </p>
    <p>
      Matt&rsquo;s amazement turned into awe.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t,&rdquo; she said, in a fearful whisper; &ldquo;it belongs to the fairies.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Brinkley laughed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It belongs to a very substantial fairy, Matt; but I don&rsquo;t think that
      to-day I will mention that fairy&rsquo;s name. Did you ever see so much, money
      in all your life before, Matt?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She shook her head, but her eyes were still fixed upon the gold.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I see,&rdquo; observed Brinkley flippantly, &ldquo;the sight of that gold fascinates
      you. Well, so it did me at first; but you see what use does. I can regard
      it now with comparative calmness. However, I have a particular wish to
      accustom <i>you</i> to the sight of wealth; therefore I shall bring you
      here and show you this now and again. Come, Matt, tell me what you would
      do if you were very rich&mdash;if all this flotsam and jetsam, in fact,
      belonged to you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Without the slightest hesitation Matt replied&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I should give it to <i>you</i>&mdash;leastways, half of it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! the reply is characteristic, and clearly shows you are not at present
      fitted to become the possessor of riches. But I shall bring you to the
      proper state of mind in time, no doubt. The next time I ask you a similar
      question you will propose to give me a third, the next an eighth, and so
      on, until you will finally come to a proper state of mind, and decline to
      give me any at all. And now that I have made you the sharer of my secret,
      we will go.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They left the cave once more, and made their way back across the
      sand-hills, Brinkley pausing to obliterate their footprints as they went.
      When they had proceeded some distance he paused, and took the girl&rsquo;s hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good-bye, Matt,&rdquo; said he. &ldquo;If it wasn&rsquo;t for that promised thrashing, I
      should certainly see you home.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then do,&rdquo; returned Matt. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care if he <i>does</i> smash me!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Probably not; but I do. It would be an episode in your career which it
      would not be pleasant to reflect upon&mdash;therefore, goodbye, Matt, and&mdash;and
      God bless you, my girl!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He gave her a fatherly salute upon the forehead; a bright flush overspread
      her cheek as she bounded away. Brinkley watched her until she was out of
      sight, then he turned, and strolled quietly on in the direction of the
      caravan.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a strange game,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and requires careful playing. I wonder
      what my next move ought to be?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He thought very deeply, but when he reached the caravan he found he had
      come to no definite conclusion as to his plans. He therefore partook
      cheerfully of the repast which Tim had prepared for him; and after he had
      smoked a couple of pipes in the open air, he retired to rest.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next morning he began pondering again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have got my trump card,&rdquo; he said to himself, &ldquo;but how to play up to it?
      I have a splendid hand, but it will want skilful playing if I am to win
      the game. One false move would do for me, for my opponents are crafty as
      foxes, and they are two against one. What is my right move, I wonder? I
      wish some good fairy would guide me!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He took out his pipe, which was his usual consoler, and smoked while he
      took a few turns on the green sward outside the caravan.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly an idea struck him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think I&rsquo;ll pay a domiciliary visit to Mr. Monk,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I can meet
      him now on pretty equal terms. If I hint a few things to him, the amiable
      gentleman may think of becoming just.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He called up Tim, and sent him on some trivial errand down to the village.
      As soon as he was well out of the way, Brinkley entered the caravan,
      produced some papers from the inner pocket of his coat, and locked them up
      securely in his trunk.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So far so good,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;My amiable friend may not be in an amiable
      mood, and I don&rsquo;t wish him to get any advantage of me!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He did not even take with him the key of the box, but having attached to
      it a small piece of paper, on which were some written instructions, he hid
      it in the caravan, and started off upon his journey.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a dark, gloomy morning, giving every promise of coming storms. As
      he passed through the wood which surrounded Monkshurst House, the wind
      whistled softly among the trees, making a moan like the sound of human
      voices.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A gloomy place,&rdquo; said Brinkley; &ldquo;a fit residence for such as he. Any dark
      deed might be committed here, and who would know?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The path which he followed was a neglected carriage-drive, strewn with
      stones, overgrown with weeds, and bordered on either side by the thick
      trees of the forest. Presently the trees parted, and he came in view of
      the house.
    </p>
    <p>
      A large gloomy-looking building, as neglected as the woodland in the
      centre of which it stood. It seemed as if only part of it was inhabited,
      and the large garden at its back was unprotected by any wall, and full of
      overgrown fruit trees.
    </p>
    <p>
      The door was opened by a grim elderly woman. He inquired for Mr. Monk, and
      was informed that he was at home. The next minute he was standing in a
      lonely library, where the owner of the house was busy writing. Monk rose,
      and the two stood face to face.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XI.&mdash;BURIED!
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">I</span>t is not my
      purpose to describe the interview which took place between my hero and Mr.
      Monk. Suffice it to say that when the young man again emerged from the
      gloomy shadows of the dwelling there was a curious smile upon his face,
      while Mr. Monk, who had followed him to the door, and watched his
      retreating figure, wore a horrible expression of hatred and fear.
    </p>
    <p>
      No sooner had he disappeared than Monk left the house also, and, following
      a footpath, through the woods, made straight for William Jones&rsquo;s cottage.
      Entering unceremoniously, he found that worthy seated beside the hearth.
      Without a word he rushed upon him, seized him by the throat, and began
      pummelling his head upon the wall.
    </p>
    <p>
      The attack was so sudden that for several minutes William Jones offered no
      resistance whatever. Indeed, so passive was he, and so violent was the
      rage of his opponent, that there was every prospect of his head being
      beaten to a jelly. Presently, however; Monk&rsquo;s fury abating, his
      unfortunate victim was allowed to pick himself up. He sat and stared
      before him, while Monk, looking like the Evil One himself, glared savagely
      in his face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You villain! You accursed, treacherous scoundrel!&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Tell me what
      you&rsquo;ve done, or I&rsquo;ll kill you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But William Jones was unconscious of having done anything, and he said as
      much, whereupon Monk&rsquo;s fury seemed about to rise again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Monk,&rdquo; cried William Jones, in terror, &ldquo;look ye now, tell me what&rsquo;s
      the matter?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I mean you to tell <i>me</i> what you have been hiding from me all these
      years. Something came ashore with that child&mdash;something that might
      lead to her identity, and you have kept it, thinking to realize money upon
      it, or to have me in your power. What means it? Speak, or I&rsquo;ll strangle
      you!&rdquo; But William Jones was evidently unable to speak, being perfectly
      paralyzed with fear. Monk stretched forth his hands to seize him again,
      when the old man, who had been a horrified spectator of all this, suddenly
      broke in with&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look ye, now, I know there was summat. It were a leetle book, stuffed in
      the front of her frock!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A book!&rdquo; returned Monk, eagerly; &ldquo;and what did you do with it? Tell me
      that, you old fool! Did you burn it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Burn it?&rdquo; exclaimed the other. &ldquo;No, mister; we don&rsquo;t burn nothin&rsquo;,
      William and me. You know where you put it, William dear, in the old
      place.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then curse you for an avaricious old devil,&rdquo; thundered Monk. &ldquo;The book
      has been stolen&mdash;do you hear!&mdash;stolen by that young painter!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He could say no more, the effect of his words upon William Jones was
      electrical. He gave one wild shriek, and began tearing his hair. It now
      became his turn to moan and rave, and for some time nothing coherent could
      be got from him.
    </p>
    <p>
      At length, however, Monk gathered that there was some secret hiding-place
      which Brinkley had discovered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thought his poking and prying meant summat,&rdquo; moaned William Jones. &ldquo;I
      fancied, too, I seen marks i&rsquo; the sand, but I never could find no one
      near, and I thought they was my own marks. Oh, what will come to me! I&rsquo;m
      ruined!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Curse your folly!&rdquo; exclaimed Monk, &ldquo;you&rsquo;ve brought it all on yourself by
      your own greed, and you don&rsquo;t deserve I should help you; but I <i>will</i>
      help you! Listen, then! It is clear that this young man has possessed
      himself somehow of your secret and mine. But from what he said to me, I
      fancy he has not as yet divulged it to a single soul. He is the only human
      being we have to fear. We must cease to fear him. Do you understand?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      No, William Jones did not understand; so in order to make his meaning
      clear, Mr. Monk drew him out from the cottage, and whispered something in
      his ear. William Jones turned as white as death, and began to tremble all
      over.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I couldn&rsquo;t do it, sir,&rdquo; he moaned. &ldquo;Look ye now&mdash;I couldn&rsquo;t do it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Monk stamped his foot impatiently; then he turned to his frightened
      victim.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Listen to me, William Jones. You ought to know by this time that I have
      both the power and determination to effect my ends. Continue to oppose me,
      and play the fool, and all that power shall be used against <i>you</i>. Do
      you hear? I will ruin, you! I will hand you over to the authorities as a
      thief&mdash;I will have you tried for concealing the papers which might
      have proved the identity of the child found washed ashore fifteen years
      ago! Do you hear?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Monk evidently knew the nature of the man with whom he had to deal,
      for after a little more conversation William Jones, cowering like a
      frightened child, promised implicit obedience.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, then,&rdquo; said Monk, when he had brought matters to a satisfactory
      termination, &ldquo;you will show me this hiding-place of yours.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      To this William Jones at first objected, but Monk was firm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who knows,&rdquo; said he, &ldquo;but there may be other things having reference to
      the child? I mean to see for myself. Now, William Jones.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So William Jones, seeing that resistance would be useless, promised to
      conduct his friend to the cave; and after a good deal of hesitation and of
      continued show of unwillingness on William Jones&rsquo;s part, the two men
      started off.
    </p>
    <p>
      When they drew near to the cave, William Jones gave a cry, and pointed to
      the sand. Looking down, Monk clearly saw footprints. They followed them,
      and found that they led right to the mouth of the cave.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s standing open!&rdquo; cried William Jones, as he pointed down with
      trembling finger.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Follow me!&rdquo; said Monk, crawling down into the hole.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jones followed in terror.
    </p>
    <p>
      As he reached the path below, he heard a sharp cry, and looking down saw,
      by the dim light of a candle stuck in the wall, Brinkley struggling
      helplessly in the powerful grip of Monk. He had been sprung upon from
      behind, and was helpless through a sort of garotte.
    </p>
    <p>
      Horrified and trembling, William Jones was rooted to his place.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly he saw the young man fall backward lifeless, and, with one last
      gasp, lie perfectly still. Monk stooped over him, and looked into his
      face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Mr. Monk!&rdquo; cried William, &ldquo;is he&mdash;is he&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He is dead,&rdquo; was the reply. &ldquo;So much the better.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As he spoke, he bent down and searched the young man&rsquo;s pockets. His brow
      blackened, for he did not find what he sought. Then he took the light from
      the wall, and held it close to Brinkley&rsquo;s eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Satisfied that he did not breathe, he climbed up the path and rejoined his
      trembling companion. They passed out of the place, hurriedly replaced the
      trap-door, and piled on sand and stones.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There!&rdquo; said Monk, with a wild smile on his deadly pale face. &ldquo;He won&rsquo;t
      trouble either of us again. Come, come!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And he strode hastily away, followed by William Jones, leaving the young
      man of the caravan in the subterranean tomb.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XII.&mdash;WILLIAM JONES IS SERIOUS.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>he two men walked
      together through the darkness as far as the door of William Jones&rsquo;s hut;
      then they parted. Mr. Monk struck across the sand-hills towards his own
      home, while Jones entered the doorway of his cabin.
    </p>
    <p>
      He would fain have found that cabin empty, for the memory of that last
      scene in the cave was still upon him, and made him as nervous as a child.
      But the old man was there, and wide-awake, and evidently pleased at his
      son&rsquo;s return.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where have you been, William dear?&rdquo; said he. The question was innocent
      enough in itself, but it was full of hidden meaning for William Jones.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where have I been?&rdquo; he repeated; &ldquo;at work to be sure!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The tone of his reply startled the old man. He looked up, and saw to his
      amazement that William was as white as a ghost, and trembling violently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter, William, dear?&rdquo; he asked eagerly. &ldquo;Have ye seen a
      wreck, my son?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I ain&rsquo;t!&rdquo; responded his son violently; &ldquo;and look ye now, old &rsquo;un,
      you jest be quiet, and let me alone, that&rsquo;s all!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The old man, knowing his son&rsquo;s temper, did as he was told, and William
      began to potter aimlessly about the room. He was certainly trembling very
      much, and was almost overcome with a nervousness for which he himself
      could not account. For he was no coward. To get possession of a prize on
      the high seas he would have faced a storm which might well make brave men
      tremble, not to mention that he knew that he had on more than one occasion
      humanely hastened the end of shipwrecked sailors, whom he had found and
      pillaged on the shore. After these acts he had been able to sleep the
      sleep of virtue without being haunted by dead men&rsquo;s eyes. But now the case
      was different. He had not to deal with a victim without friends, a man
      whose body, described as that of a &ldquo;shipwrecked mariner,&rdquo; could be buried
      and forgotten without any more ado. In all probability there would this
      time be a hue and cry, and William Jones trembled lest his share in the
      ghastly business might ultimately be discovered.
    </p>
    <p>
      True, he was not actually the culprit, and so, even at the worst, he might
      escape the gallows&mdash;but to a man of his sensitive and affectionate
      nature the thought of transportation was not pleasant. It was this that
      made him nervous&mdash;this that made him start and tremble at every
      sound.
    </p>
    <p>
      Presently a thought struck him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where&rsquo;s Matt?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t know, William, dear; she ain&rsquo;t been here for hours and hours. Maybe
      she&rsquo;s on the shore.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Maybe she is. I&rsquo;ll go and have a look,&rdquo; returned William.
    </p>
    <p>
      It must not be supposed for a moment that William Jones had become
      afflicted with a sudden and tender interest in Matt&mdash;he merely wanted
      to get quit of the cabin, that was all, and he saw in this a reasonable
      excuse for walking out alone. He accordingly made his escape, and went
      wandering off along the shore.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was ten o&rsquo;clock when he returned; he was still pale, and drenched to
      the skin. The old man was dozing beside the fire, and alone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where&rsquo;s Matt?&rdquo; asked William again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ain&rsquo;t you seen her, William, dear? Well, she ain&rsquo;t here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      William Jones did look a little uneasy this time, and it is but due to him
      to confess that his uneasiness was caused by Matt&rsquo;s prolonged absence.
      Erratic as she was in her movements, she had not been accustomed to
      staying out so late, especially on a night when the rain was pouring, and
      not a glimmer of star or moon was to be seen.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wonder what she&rsquo;s doin&rsquo; of?&rdquo; said William; &ldquo;suppose I&rsquo;d best wait up for
      her.. Here, old man, you go to bed, d&rsquo;ye: hear&mdash;<i>you</i> ain&rsquo;t
      wanted anyhow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The old man accordingly went to bed, and William sat up to await Matt&rsquo;s
      return. He sat beside the hearth, looked into the smouldering fire, and
      listened to the rain as it poured down steadily upon the roof.
      Occasionally he got up, and went to the door; he could see nothing, but he
      heard the patter of the falling rain, and the low dreary moan of the
      troubled sea.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hour after hour passed, and Matt did not come. William Jones began to doze
      by the fire&mdash;then he sank into a heavy sleep.
    </p>
    <p>
      He awoke with a start, and found that it was broad daylight. The fire was
      out, the rain had ceased to fall, and the morning sun was creeping in at
      the windows. He looked round, and saw that he was still alone. He went
      into Matt&rsquo;s room&mdash;it was empty. She had not returned.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was now filled with vague uneasiness. He made up a bit of fire, and was
      about to issue forth again in search of the truant, when all further
      trouble was saved him&mdash;the door opened, and Matt herself appeared.
    </p>
    <p>
      She seemed almost as much disturbed as William Jones himself. Her face was
      very pale, her hair wild, her dress in great disorder. She started on
      seeing him; then, assuming rather a devil-may-care look, she lounged in.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&rsquo;re up early, William Jones,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I am up early,&rdquo; he replied gruffly; &ldquo;&rsquo;cause why?&mdash;&rsquo;cause
      I ain&rsquo;t been to bed. And where have <i>you</i> been&mdash;jest you tell me
      that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why,&mdash;I&rsquo;ve been out, of course!&rdquo; returned the girl defiantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That won&rsquo;t do, Matt,&rdquo; returned William Jones. &ldquo;Come, you&rsquo;ll jest tell me
      where you&rsquo;ve been. You ain&rsquo;t been out all night for nothing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The girl gave him a look half of defiance, half of curiosity; then she
      threw herself down, rather than sat, upon a chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m tired, I am,&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;and hungry, and cold!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will you tell me where you&rsquo;ve been, Matt?&rdquo; cried William Jones, trembling
      with suspicious alarm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;&lsquo;Course I will, if you keep quiet,&rdquo; said the girl in answer. &ldquo;There ain&rsquo;t
      much to tell neither. I were away along to Pencroes when the heavy rain
      came on, then I lay down behind a haystack and fell asleep, and when I
      woke up it was daylight, and I came home.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      William Jones looked at her steadfastly and long; then, as if satisfied,
      he turned away. About an hour later he left the hut and walked along the
      shore, straining his eyes seaward. But instead of looking steadfastly at
      one spot, as his custom was, he paused now and again to gaze uneasily
      about him. At every sound he started and turned pale. In truth, he was
      becoming a veritable coward&mdash;afraid almost of the sound of his own
      footsteps on the sands.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XIII.&mdash;THE CARAVAN DISAPPEARS.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">S</span>everal days passed
      away, during which William Jones showed a strange and significant
      affection for his own fireside. He went out a little in the sunlight; but
      directly night came he locked and barricaded the door as if against
      thieves, and declined, on any inducement, to cross the threshold. Even had
      a three-decker gone ashore in the neighbourhood, he would have thought
      twice before issuing forth into the dreaded darkness.
    </p>
    <p>
      For William Jones was genuinely afraid; his hereditary calm of mind was
      shaken, not so much with horror at a murderous deed, as with consternation
      that his lifelong secret had been discovered by one man, and might, sooner
      or later, be discovered by others. He did not put implicit faith even in
      Monk; it was his nature to trust nobody where money was concerned.
    </p>
    <p>
      As to returning to the cave until he had quite recovered his equanimity,
      that was out of the question. Even by daylight he avoided the spot with a
      holy horror. Only in his dreams, which were dark and troubled, did he
      visit it,&mdash;to see the face of the murdered man in the darkness, and
      the hand of the murdered man pointing at him with cold, decaying finger.
    </p>
    <p>
      The day after the murder he had been greatly unsettled by a visit from Tim
      Lenney, who demanded news of his master, and said that he had not returned
      to the caravan all night. Tim seemed greatly troubled, but gave vent to no
      very violent ebullitions of grief. When he was gone Matt sat by the
      fireside, and looked long and keenly at William Jones.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What are you staring at?&rdquo; cried he, fidgeting uneasily under her gaze.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nowt,&rdquo; said Matt; &ldquo;I were only wondering&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then don&rsquo;t go wondering,&rdquo; exclaimed the good man rather inconsistently. &ldquo;<i>You</i>
      mind your own business, and don&rsquo;t be a fool!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And he turned testily and gazed at the fire. But Matt, whose eyes were
      full of a curious light, was not to be abashed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ain&rsquo;t you well, William Jones?&rdquo; she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m well enough,&mdash;I am.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s queer, ain&rsquo;t it, that the painter chap never come home?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How should I know?&rdquo; growled William. &ldquo;Maybe he&rsquo;s gone back to where he
      come from.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Or maybe he&rsquo;s drownded? Or maybe summat else has happened to him?&rdquo;
       suggested Matt.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never you mind <i>him</i>, my gal. <i>He&rsquo;s</i> all right, never fear. And
      if he ain&rsquo;t, it&rsquo;s no affair o&rsquo; yours, or mine neither. <i>You</i> go along
      out and play.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Matt went out as directed, and it was some hours before she returned. She
      found her guardian seated in his old place by the fire, looking at
      vacancy. He started violently as she entered, and made a clutch at the
      rude piece of ship&rsquo;s iron which served as a poker.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Be it you, Matt? Lor&rsquo;, how you startled me I I were&mdash;I were&mdash;taking
      a doze.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been up yonder,&rdquo; said Matt.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Up wheer?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Up to the painter chap&rsquo;s cart. He ain&rsquo;t come back; and the man&rsquo;s
      searchin&rsquo; for him all up and down the place.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Fortunately it was very dark, so that she could not see the expression of
      her hearer&rsquo;s face. She walked to the fireplace, and, taking a box of
      lucifers from a ledge, began to procure a light, with the view of igniting
      the rushlight fixed to the table. But in a moment &ldquo;William blew out the
      match, and snatched the box from her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What are you doin&rsquo; of?&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;Wasting the matches, as if they cost
      nowt. You&rsquo;ll come to the workus, afore you&rsquo;re done.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The days passed, and there was no news of the absent man. Every day Matt
      went up to the caravan to make inquiries. At last, one afternoon, she
      returned looking greatly troubled; her eyes were red, too, as if she had
      been crying.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What&rsquo;s the matter now?&rdquo; demanded William, who had left his usual seat and
      was standing at the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nowt,&rdquo; said Matt, wiping her eyelids with the back of her hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you tell no lies. You&rsquo;ve heerd summat? Stop! What&rsquo;s that theer
      under your arm?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      All at once he had perceived that she carried a large roll of something
      wrapped in brown paper. He took it from her, and opened it nervously. It
      was the crayon portrait of herself executed by the defunct artist.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who gave you this here?&rdquo; cried William Jones, trembling more than ever.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tim.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who&rsquo;s <i>he?</i>&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Him as come looking arter his master. The painter chap ain&rsquo;t found; and
      now Tim&rsquo;s goin&rsquo; away in the cart to tell his friends. And he give me this&mdash;my
      pictur&rsquo;; he give me it to keep. His master said I were to have it; and I
      mean to keep it now he&rsquo;s dead!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      William Jones handed back the picture, and seemed relieved, indeed, when
      it was out of his hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dead?&rdquo; he muttered, not meeting Matt&rsquo;s eyes, but looking right out to
      sea. &ldquo;Who told you he were dead?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Matt did not reply, but gazed at William so long and so significantly,
      that the good man, conscious of her scrutiny, turned and plunged into the
      darkness of his dwelling.
    </p>
    <p>
      An hour later a loud voice summoned him forth. He went to the door, and
      there was Monk of Monkshurst. It was the first time they had met since
      they parted on the night of the murder. Monk was dressed in a dark summer
      suit, and looked unusually spick and span.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where&rsquo;s the girl?&rdquo; he cried, after a whispered colloquy of some minutes.
      &ldquo;Matt, where are you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In answer to the call Matt appeared at the door. No sooner did she
      perceive Monk than she trembled violently, and went very pale.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come here, Matt,&rdquo; he said with an insinuating smile. &ldquo;See! I&rsquo;ve brought
      something for you&mdash;something pretty for you to wear.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As he spoke he drew from his waistcoat pocket a small gold ring, set with
      turquoise stones. But Matt still trembled, and shrank away.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want it!&mdash;I sha&rsquo;n&rsquo;t wear it,&rdquo; she cried.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nonsense, Matt!&rdquo; said Monk. &ldquo;Why, it&rsquo;s a ring fit for a lady. Come, let
      me put it on your finger.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So great seemed her agitation, so deep her dread of him, that she could
      not stir; so that when he approached, laughing, and caught her round the
      waist, he slipped the ring on her finger before she could resist. But it
      only remained there a moment. With a quick, sharp cry, she tore herself
      free, and, taking the ring off, threw it right away from her upon the
      sand. Then, with a wild gesture of fear and loathing, she rushed into the
      cottage.
    </p>
    <p>
      William Jones walked over and picked up the ring, while Monk stood
      scowling darkly after the fugitive.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What the devil ails the girl?&rdquo; cried the latter, with a fierce oath,
      pocketing the present.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I dunno. She&rsquo;s never been the same since&mdash;since the painter chap
      went missing. I&rsquo;m afeerd he turned the gal&rsquo;s head.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He&rsquo;ll turn no more heads,&rdquo; muttered Monk under his breath; then added
      aloud and with decision, &ldquo;There must be an end to this. She must be
      married to me at once.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you mean it, master? When you spoke on it fust I thought you was
      joking.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you were a fool for your pains. She&rsquo;s old enough, and bold enough,
      and vixenish enough; but I&rsquo;ll tame her. I tell you there must be no more
      delay. My mind&rsquo;s made up, and I&rsquo;ll wait no longer.&rdquo; Sinking their voices
      they continued to talk together for some time. Now Matt was crouching
      close to the threshold, and had heard every word of the above
      conversation, and much that followed it. When Monk walked away and
      disappeared, leaving William Jones ruminant at the broken gate, she
      suddenly reappeared.
    </p>
    <p>
      Curiously enough all her excitement had departed. Instead of weeping or
      protesting, she looked at William Jones&mdash;and laughed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Monk had left his horse at the coastguard station. Remounting, he rode
      rapidly away through the sand-hills in the direction of the lake. As he
      approached the spot of the old encampment, he saw that the caravan had
      gone.
    </p>
    <p>
      He rode on thoughtfully till he gained the highway, when he put his horse
      into a rapid trot. Just before he gained the gate and avenue near to which
      he had first encountered Brinkley, he saw the caravan before him on the
      dusty road.
    </p>
    <p>
      He hesitated for a moment; then hurried rapidly forward, and, arriving
      close to the vehicle, saw the Irishman&rsquo;s head looking round at him from
      the driver&rsquo;s seat. He beckoned, and Tim pulled up.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Has your master returned? I am informed that he has been missing for some
      days.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Tim shook his head very dolefully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, sor I sorra sight have I seen of him for three days and three nights.
      I&rsquo;m going back wid the baste and the house, to tell his friends the bad
      news. Maybe it&rsquo;s making fun of me he is, and I&rsquo;ll find him somewhere on
      the road.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hope you will,&rdquo; said Monk sympathetically. &ldquo;I think&mdash;hum&mdash;it
      is quite possible he has, as you suggest, wandered homeward. Good-day to
      you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      So saying, Monk turned off by the gate which they had just reached, and
      rode away up the avenue.
    </p>
    <p>
      Tim looked after him till he disappeared. Then the same curious change
      came over him which had come over Matt after she had been listening to the
      colloquy between Monk and William Jones.
    </p>
    <p>
      He laughed!

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XIV.&mdash;A BRIDAL PARTY AND A LITTLE SURPRISE.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">A</span> week passed away.
      The shadow of the caravan no longer fell on the green meadow by the lake,
      and the straggling population of Aberglyn, unsuspicious of foul play, had
      already forgotten both the caravan and the owner.
    </p>
    <p>
      And if facts were to be taken into consideration in estimating the extent
      of her memory, Matt too had forgotten. It was common talk now, that she,
      the grammarless castaway, the neglected <i>protégée</i> of William Jones,
      was to be married to the master of the great house! Nay, the very day was
      fixed; and that very day was only two sunrises distant; and Monk of
      Monkshurst had in his pocket a special license, which he had procured, at
      an expenditure of five pounds, from London.
    </p>
    <p>
      Doubtless, in any other more populous locality the affair would have
      occasioned no little scandal, and many ominous shakings of the head; but
      the inhabitants were few and far between, and had little or no time for
      idle gossiping. The coastguardsmen and their wives were the only
      individuals who exhibited any interest, and even their excitement was
      faint and evanescent, like the movements of a fish in a shallow and
      unwholesome pool.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the really extraordinary part of the whole affair was the conduct of
      Matt herself. Apparently quite cured of her former repugnance to a union
      with Monk, she made no objection whatever to the performance of the
      ceremony, and laughed merrily when she was informed that the day was
      fixed. Monk, in his grim, taciturn way, was jubilant. He came to and fro
      constantly, and assumed the manners of a lover. Had he been less bent on
      one particular object two things might have struck him as curious:&mdash;(1)
      That Matt, though she had consented to marry him, steadfastly refused to
      wear his ring, or accept any other presents; and (2) that she still
      shrunk, with persistent and ill-disguised dislike, from his caresses.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was now late in the month of August, and the weather was broken by
      troublous winds and a fretful moon. For several weeks William Jones, in
      his mortal terror, had refrained from visiting the cave; he had never set
      his foot therein, indeed, since the night of the assassination. At last he
      could bear the suspense no longer. Suppose some one else had discovered
      his treasure, and robbed him? Suppose some subterranean change had
      obliterated the landmarks or submerged the cavern! Suppose a thousand
      dreadful things! Tired of miserable supposition, William determined,
      despite his terror, to make sure.
    </p>
    <p>
      So late one windy and rainy night he stole forth with his unlit lantern,
      and fought his way in the teeth of half a gale to the familiar place,
      which he found, however, with some little difficulty. He was neither
      superstitious nor imaginative, but throughout the journey he was a prey to
      nameless terrors. Every gust of wind went through his heart like a knife;
      every sound of wind or sea made that same heart stop and listen. Only
      supreme greed and miserly anxiety led him on. But at last he gained the
      cave, within which there was a sound as of clashing legions, clarions
      shrieking, drums beating, all the storm and stress of the awful waters
      clashing on the cliffs without, and boiling with unusual screams through
      the black slit between the cave and the Devil&rsquo;s Cauldron.
    </p>
    <p>
      Trembling, with perspiration standing in great beads on his face, he
      searched the cave for the corpse of the murdered man, expecting to find it
      well advanced in decomposition. Strange to say, however, it had
      disappeared.
    </p>
    <p>
      William Jones was at once relieved and alarmed; relieved because he was
      spared a horrible experience; alarmed because he could not account for the
      disappearance.
    </p>
    <p>
      A little reflection, however, suggested that one of those tidal waves so
      common on the coast might have arisen well up into the cavern, washed away
      the body from its place on the shingle, and carried it away in the
      direction of the Cauldron.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In which case,&rdquo; he reflected, &ldquo;them coastguard chaps would find it some
      day among the rocks or on the shore, and think it had been drowned in the
      way of natur&rsquo;.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Satisfied that everything else was undisturbed, he retired as hastily as
      possible, sealed up the entrance to the cavern, and ran hastily home.
    </p>
    <p>
      The morning of the marriage came&mdash;a fine sunny morning. An open
      dog-cart belonging to Monk, and driven by one of his servants, stood at
      William Jones&rsquo;s door, and close to it a light country cart, borrowed by
      William Jones himself from a neighbouring farmer. The population,
      consisting of an aged coastguardsman, two coastguardsmen&rsquo;s wives, and
      half-a-dozen dejected children, crowded in front of the cottage.
    </p>
    <p>
      The bridegroom, attired in decent black, with a flower in his button-hole,
      stood waiting impatiently in the garden. Despite the festive occasion, he
      had a gloomy and hangdog appearance. Presently there emerged from the door
      William Jones, attired in a drowned seaman&rsquo;s suit several sizes too large
      for him, and wearing a chimney-pot hat and a white rosette. Leaning on his
      arm was Matt, dressed in a dress of blue silk, neatly made for her by one
      of the coastguard women, out of damaged materials supplied by Jones, a
      light straw hat with blue ribbons to match, and a light lace shawl. Behind
      this pair hobbled William Jones&rsquo;s father, whose costume was nautical like
      his son&rsquo;s, but more damaged, and who also sported a chimney-pot hat and a
      white rosette.
    </p>
    <p>
      The crowd gave a feeble cheer. Matt looked round and smiled, but mingled
      with her smile there was a kind of vague anxiety and expectation.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was arranged that Monk should drive Matt in the dog-cart, while William
      Jones and his father followed in the commoner vehicle. At Pencroes, where
      the ceremony was to be performed, they were to meet with one Mr. Penarvon,
      a country squire and kindred spirit of Monk&rsquo;s, who had promised to be
      &ldquo;best man.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Monk took the reins, while Matt got in and seated herself beside him, the
      groom getting up behind; and away they went along the sand-choked road,
      followed by Jones and his father.
    </p>
    <p>
      The day was bright and merry, but Matt never thought of the old proverb,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Happy is the bride that the sun shines on;&rdquo; she was too busy examining
      the prospect on every side of her. All at once, as the bridal procession
      wound round the edge of the lonely lake, she uttered a cry of delight.
      There, standing in its old place by the lake-side, was the caravan.
    </p>
    <p>
      Monk looked pale&mdash;there was something ghostly in the re-appearance
      even of this inanimate object. He was a man of strong nerve, however, and
      he speedily smiled at his own fears.
    </p>
    <p>
      As they approached the spot they saw Tim standing near the vehicle in
      conversation with two strange gentlemen, one a little elderly man in black
      broadcloth, the other a tall, broad-shouldered fellow, wearing a light
      overcoat and a wideawake hat. Directly the procession approached, this
      group separated, and its three members walked severally into the road, he
      with the wideawake hat standing right in the centre of the road quietly
      smoking a cigar.
    </p>
    <p>
      As the dog-cart came up he held up his hand. Unable to proceed without
      running him down, Monk pulled up angrily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is it? Why do you block the road?&rdquo; he cried fiercely, &ldquo;Excuse me,
      governor,&rdquo; returned the other coolly. &ldquo;Mr. Monk of Monkhurst, I believe?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That&rsquo;s my name.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sorry to trouble you on such a day, but I should like a few words with
      you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I cannot stay&mdash;I am going to be married!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So I heard,&rdquo; said the man, lifting his hat and bowing with a grin to
      Matt. &ldquo;Glad to see you, miss. How do you do? But the fact is, Mr. Monk, my
      business won&rsquo;t keep. Be good enough to step this way.&rdquo; Full of some
      unaccountable foreboding, inspired partly by the stranger&rsquo;s suave, yet
      determined, manner, partly by the reappearance of the caravan, Monk
      alighted, and followed the other across the grass to the close vicinity of
      the house on wheels. The little elderly man followed, and the man who had
      first spoken went through the ceremony of introduction.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is Mr. Monk, sir. Mr. Monk, this gentleman is Mr. Lightwood, of the
      firm of Lightwood and Lightwood, solicitors, Chester.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you&mdash;who the devil are <i>you?</i>&rdquo; demanded Monk with his old
      savagery.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My name is Marshall, Christian name, John, though my friends call me
      Jack,&rdquo; answered the other with airy impudence. &ldquo;John Marshall, governor,
      of the detective force.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Monk now went pale indeed. But recovering himself he cried, &ldquo;I know
      neither of you. I warned you that I was in haste. What do you want? Out
      with it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The little man now took up the conversation, speaking in a prim
      business-like voice, and occasionally referring to a large note-book which
      he carried.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Monk, you are, I am informed, the sole heir male of the late Colonel
      Monk, your cousin by the father&rsquo;s side, who was supposed to have died in
      India in the year 1862.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, that&rsquo;s true. What then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;On the report of his death, his name being included in an official list
      of officers killed and wounded in action, and it being understood that he
      died without lawful issue, you laid claim to the demesne of Monkshurst, in
      Cheshire, and that of the same name in Anglesea. Your claim was
      recognized, and in 1864 you took possession.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well. Have you detained me to hear only what I already knew?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pardon me, I have not finished. I have now to inform you that you
      inherited under a misconception, first because Colonel Monk was married
      and had issue, secondly, because he did not die in India, but reached the
      shores of England, where he perished in the shipwreck of the ship <i>Trinidad</i>,
      in the year 1864.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Monk was livid. At this moment Jones, who had been watching the scene from
      a distance, came over, panting and perspiring in ill-concealed terror.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lor&rsquo;, Mr. Monk, what&rsquo;s the matter? Look ye now, we shall be late for the
      wedding.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As he spoke Marshall, the detective, clapped him playfully on the
      shoulder.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How d&rsquo;ye do, William Jones? I&rsquo;ve often heard of you, and wished to know
      you. Pray stop where you are. I&rsquo;ll talk to <i>you</i> presently.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what you mean,&rdquo; Monk now said with dogged desperation, &ldquo;with
      all this rigmarole, Mr. Lightwood, or whatever your name is. It seems to
      me you are simply raving. If I am not my cousin&rsquo;s heir, who is, tell me
      that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;His daughter,&rdquo; said the man quietly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He never married, and he never had a daughter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;His daughter, an infant twelve or fourteen months old, sailed to England
      with him, was shipwrecked with him, but saved by a special Providence, and
      has since been living in this place under the name of Matt Jones.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your intended bride, you know,&rdquo; added Marshall with an insinuating smile.
      &ldquo;Hullo, where <i>is</i> the young lady?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Monk looked round towards the dog-cart and on every side, but Matt was
      nowhere to-be seen.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I see her go into that theer cart,&rdquo; said William Jones.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Call her,&rdquo; cried Monk. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll stay no longer here. Listen to me, you two.
      Whether you are telling truth or lies, that girl is going to become my
      wife&mdash;I have her guardian&rsquo;s consent, and she herself, I may tell you,
      fully appreciates the honour I am doing her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Indeed!&rdquo; said Mr. Lightwood, smiling. &ldquo;Unfortunately I, as Miss Monk&rsquo;s
      legal adviser, must have a say in the matter. Doubtless this marriage
      would be a very pretty arrangement for keeping the late Colonel Monk&rsquo;s
      fortune and property in your possession, but I cannot conscientiously
      approve of the young lady&rsquo;s marriage to an <i>assassin</i>.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;An assassin!&mdash;what&mdash;what do you mean?&rdquo; gasped Monk, staggering
      as if from a blow.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell him, Mr. Marshall.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right, sir. Well, you see, Mr. Monk of Monkshurst,&rdquo; continued the
      detective, grimly yet playfully, &ldquo;you&rsquo;re accused of making away with&mdash;murdering,
      in fact&mdash;a young gentleman who came to Aberglyn a few weeks ago in
      that little house on wheels; and this nice friend of yours,&rdquo; (here he
      again slapped William Jones on the shoulder) &ldquo;is accused of being your
      accomplice.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no. I never done it! I&rsquo;m innocent, I am!&rdquo; cried William Jones. &ldquo;Tell
      &rsquo;em, Mr. Monk, tell &rsquo;em&mdash;I&rsquo;d nowt to do with it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Silence, you fool,&rdquo; said the other; then he added, turning on his
      accusers, &ldquo;You are a couple of madmen, I think! I know nothing of the
      young man you speak of! I have heard that he is missing, that is all; but
      there is no evidence that any harm has come to him, for his body has not
      been found.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Here Marshall turned with a wink to William Jones, and nudged him in the
      ribs.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you think now,&rdquo; he asked, &ldquo;it might be worth while looking for it
      in <i>that little underground parlour</i> of yours, down alongside the
      sea?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      William Jones uttered a despairing groan, and fell on his knees.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&rsquo;m ruined!&rdquo; he cried. &ldquo;Oh, Mr. Monk, it&rsquo;s your doing! Lord help me! They
      knows everything.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Curse you, hold your tongue!&rdquo; said Monk, with a look of mad contempt and
      hatred. &ldquo;These men are only playing upon your fears, but they cannot
      frighten <i>me.</i>&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No?&rdquo; remarked the detective, lighting his cigar, which had gone out. &ldquo;I
      think we shall even manage <i>that</i> in time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As he spoke he carelessly, and as if inadvertently, drew out a pair of
      steel handcuffs, which he looked at reflectively, threw up and caught
      underhand in the air.
    </p>
    <div class="fig" style="width:50%;">
      <img src="images/0010.jpg" alt="0010 " width="100%" /><br />
    </div>
        <p>
      &ldquo;You accuse me of assassination?&rdquo; said Monk, trembling violently. &ldquo;I warn
      you to beware, for I will not suffer such accusations without seeking
      redress. If you have any proof of the truth of your preposterous charge,
      produce it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At this moment Matt, looking bright as sunshine, leaped out of the
      caravan.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There&rsquo;s my proof,&rdquo; said Marshall. &ldquo;Miss Monk, this amiable bridegroom of
      yours denies being concerned in harming Mr. Charles Brinkley. Is he
      telling the truth?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Matt&rsquo;s face darkened, and she looked at Monk with eyes of cordial
      detestation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;he&rsquo;s lying!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Matt,&rdquo; cried Monk fiercely, &ldquo;take care!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He&rsquo;s lying,&rdquo; she repeated, not heeding him. &ldquo;I see him do it with my own
      two eyes, and I see William Jones helping him and looking on. They thought
      that no one was nigh, but <i>I</i> was. I was hiding behind them sacks and
      barrels in the cave!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <hr />
    <p>
      <br /><br />
    </p>
    <p>
      Monk now felt that the game was almost up, for he was beset on every side,
      and the very ground seemed opening under his feet. The wretched Jones, in
      a state bordering on frenzy, remained on his knees wailing over his own
      ruin. The two strangers, Lightwood and Marshall, looked on as calm but
      interested spectators. Matt, having delivered her home-thrust of
      accusation, stood and gazed into Monk&rsquo;s face with cool defiance, &ldquo;It is a
      plot!&rdquo; Monk cried, presently, &ldquo;an infamous plot to ruin me! You have-been
      tampering, I see, with this wild girl, whom you foolishly suppose kin to
      me by blood. Arrest me, if you please&mdash;I shall not take the trouble
      to resist, for I am perfectly innocent in this matter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He added, while they looked at one another as if somewhat puzzled&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;As to the girl&rsquo;s relationship with my dead cousin, the very idea is
      absurd. Where are the proofs of her birthright?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here,&rdquo; said a quiet voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      Monk turned his eyes and started back in wonder, while William Jones
      shrieked and fell forward on his face. Standing before them in the
      sunshine was the reality or the semblance of&mdash;the murdered young man
      of the caravan!

    <h2>
      CHAPTER XV.&mdash;THE &ldquo;MURDERED&rdquo; MAN!
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">Y</span>es, it was the
      artist himself, looking a little pale, and carrying one arm in a sling,
      but otherwise, to all appearance, in good health.
    </p>
    <p>
      Monk had strong nerves, but he could not prevent himself from uttering a
      wild cry of horror and wonder. At the same moment, Matt went to the young
      man&rsquo;s side, and with an air of indescribable trust and sweetness, took his
      hand&mdash;the hand which was free&mdash;and put it to her lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The proof is here,&rdquo; he said calmly, &ldquo;here upon my person. I am not quite
      dead, you see, Mr. Monk of Monkshurst, and I thought I should like to
      bring it you myself. It consists, as you are aware, of Colonel Monk&rsquo;s
      dying message, written on the fly-leaf of his Prayer-book, and of the
      marriage certificate of his wife; both these having been placed upon his
      child&rsquo;s person, concealed by the unsuspecting and illiterate Jones, and
      found by me after a lapse of many years.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Monk did not speak; his tongue was frozen. He stood aghast, opening and
      shutting his clenched hands spasmodically, and shaking like a leaf.
      Reassured to some extent by the sound of the voice, unmistakably
      appertaining to a person of flesh and blood, William Jones gradually
      uplifted his face, and looked in ghastly wonder at the speaker.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will be anxious to ascertain,&rdquo; proceeded Brinkley, with his old air
      of lightness, &ldquo;by what accident, or special Providence, I arose from the
      grave in which you politely entombed me. The explanation is very simple.
      My young friend here, Matt, the foundling, or, as I should rather call
      her, Miss Monk of Monkshurst, came to my assistance, attended to my
      injuries, which were not so serious as you imagined, and enabled me,
      before daybreak, to gain the kindly shelter of my caravan. Tim and a
      certain rural doctor did the rest. I am sorry to disappoint you, Mr. Monk,
      but I felt bound to keep my promise&mdash;to interfere seriously with your
      little arrangements, if you persistently refused to do justice to this
      young lady.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As he spoke, Monk uttered a savage oath and rushed towards the road; but
      Marshall was after him in a moment, and sprang upon him. There was a quick
      struggle. Suddenly Monk drew a knife, opened it, and brandished it in the
      air; so that it would have gone ill with his assailant if the herculean
      Tim, coming to the rescue, had not pinioned him from behind. In another
      moment the knife was lying on the grass, and Monk was neatly handcuffed by
      the detective.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, governor, you&rsquo;d better take it quietly!&rdquo; said Marshall, while Monk
      struggled, and gnashed his teeth in impotent rage. &ldquo;You&rsquo;re a smart one,
      you are, but the game&rsquo;s up at last.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Monk recovered himself and laughed fiercely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let me go! Of what do you accuse me? It was murder just now, but since
      the murdered person is alive (curse him!) I should like to know on what
      charge you arrest me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, there&rsquo;s no difficulty about that!&rdquo; said Brinkley, looking at him
      superciliously. &ldquo;In the first place, you have by fraud and perjury
      possessed yourself of what never legally belonged to you. In the second
      place, you <i>attempted</i> murder, at any rate. But upon my life, I don&rsquo;t
      think you are worth prosecuting. I think, Mr. Marshall, you might let him
      go.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It&rsquo;s letting a mad dog loose, sir,&rdquo; replied Marshall. &ldquo;He&rsquo;ll hurt
      somebody.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do <i>you</i> say, Miss Monk?&rdquo; said Brinkley. &ldquo;This amiable-looking
      person is your father&rsquo;s cousin. Shall I release your bridegroom, in order
      that you may go with him to the altar of Hymen and complete the ceremony?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hate him,&rdquo; cried Matt; &ldquo;I should like to drown him in the sea.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Brinkley laughed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your sentiments are natural, but unchristian. And the gentle Jones, now,
      who is looking at you so affectionately, what would you do with <i>him?</i>
      Drown him in the sea too?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, no, Matt,&rdquo; interposed William Jones, abjectly; &ldquo;speak up for me,
      Matt. I ha&rsquo; been father to you all these years.&rdquo; Matt seemed perplexed
      what to say. So Brinkley again took up the conversation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;On reflection we will refer William Jones to his friends the &lsquo;coastguard
      chaps.&rsquo; I think he will be punished enough by the distribution of his
      little property in the cave. Eh, Mr. Jones?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Jones only wrung his hands and wailed, thinking of his precious treasure.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And so, Matt,&rdquo; continued Brinkley, &ldquo;there will be no wedding after all.
      I&rsquo;m afraid you&rsquo;re awfully disappointed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Matt replied by taking his hand again, lifting it to her lips and kissing
      it fondly. The young man turned his head away, for his eyes had suddenly
      grown full of grateful tears.

      CONCLUSION.
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">M</span>y tale is told.
      The adventure of the caravan has ended. Little more remains to be said.
    </p>
    <p>
      Monk of Monkshurst was not brought to trial for his iniquities, but he was
      sorely enough punished by the loss of his ill-gotten estates. Before the
      claim of the foundling was fully proved he left England, never to return.
      Whether he is alive or dead I cannot tell.
    </p>
    <p>
      William Jones, too, escaped legal punishment. A severer retribution came
      upon him in the seizure and dispersal of the hoards in the great cave. So
      sorely did he take his loss to heart that he crept to his bed and had an
      attack of brain fever. When he reappeared on the scene of his old
      plunderings his intellect was weakened, and he showed curious evidences of
      imbecility. But the ruling passion remained strong within him. I saw him
      only last summer, rambling on the sea-shore, talking incoherently to
      himself, and watching the sea in search of wreckage, as of old.
    </p>
    <p>
      And Matt?
    </p>
    <p>
      Well, her title to Monkshurst and the property was fully proved. For a
      long time she did not realize her good fortune, but gradually the pleasant
      truth dawned upon her in a sunrise of nice dresses, jewellery, and plenty
      of money. Chancery stepped in like a severe foster-parent, and sent her to
      school. There she remained for several years; but Charles Brinkley, who
      had first taken in hand the vindication of her claims, and who never
      ceased to be interested in her, saw her from time to time, and took
      particular note of her improvement in her grammar and the gentle art of
      speech.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Matt,&rdquo; he said, when they met last Christmas in London, and when he saw
      before him, instead of a towsy girl, as bright and buxom a young lady as
      ever wore purple raiment and fine linen, &ldquo;Matt, you are &lsquo;growed up&rsquo; at
      last!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Matt blushed and hung her head, with a touch of her old manner.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I am grown up, as you say. I wonder what William Jones would think
      if he saw me now?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And if he noticed those pretty boots, Matt, and heard you play the piano
      and prattle a little in French. Upon my word, it&rsquo;s a transformation! You
      always were a nice girl, though.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you really think so?&rdquo; asked Matt, shyly. &ldquo;Did you <i>always</i> think
      so?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Even when I told you I liked you so much, and you told me &lsquo;it wouldn&rsquo;t
      do?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was Brinkley&rsquo;s turn to blush now. It was clear that Matt, despite other
      changes, still retained her indomitable frankness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Even then,&rdquo; he replied, laughing. &ldquo;But I say, you were a precocious
      youngster. You <i>proposed</i> to me, you know!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know I did,&rdquo; said Matt, &ldquo;and it wasn&rsquo;t leap year then&rdquo;&mdash;she added
      still more slyly&mdash;&ldquo;But it&rsquo;s leap year <i>now!</i>&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Their eyes met. Both blushed more and more.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Matt, don&rsquo;t! It won&rsquo;t do, you know! Yes, I say so still. You&rsquo;re a rich
      woman, and I&rsquo;m only a poor devil of a painter. You must marry some great
      swell.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But Matt replied&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall never marry any one but <i>you!</i>&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You won&rsquo;t? Do you mean it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course I do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He caught her in his arms.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My darling Matt&mdash;yes, I shall call you by that dear name to the end
      of the chapter. You love me, then? I can&rsquo;t believe it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have loved you,&rdquo; she answered, laughing, &ldquo;ever since I first came&mdash;&lsquo;to
      be took!&rsquo;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And she rested her head on his shoulder, just as she had done in the old
      days, when she was an unsophisticated child of Nature.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So there&rsquo;s to be a wedding, after all,&rdquo; he said, kissing her. &ldquo;Matt, I&rsquo;ve
      an idea!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When we marry, suppose we arrange to spend the honeymoon in&mdash;a
      CARAVAN!&rdquo;
     </p>

States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm

eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the

volunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous
locations. Its business office is located at 809 North 1500 West, Salt

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
